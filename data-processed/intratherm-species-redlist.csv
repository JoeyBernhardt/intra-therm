Lives up to 20 years. Spawns for the first time at 5-6 years, 550-700 mm SL and 5-10 kg, earlier and smaller in subtropical areas. Migrates long distances upriver at the beginning of a rapid flood and water-level increases (in April-July depending on locality). Spawns during floods. Stops spawning if condition change and starts again with increase of water level. Spawns in upper water layer or even at water surfaces. Females spawn up to 1.1 million eggs in 1-3 portions depending on duration of high-water period. Eggs are yellowish, transparent, and hatch after about 2 days at temperatures around 25°C while drifting downstream in the deep open-water layer. If the river flow is blocked or if available river stretches are too short, eggs cannot drift long enough and fail to develop. After spawning, adults leave the river and migrate back to forage habitats. Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current. In autumn-winter, when temperatures falls to 10°C, juveniles and adults form separate large schools and move downstream to deeper places in the main course of river to overwinter.

1139469,166627,Lates calcarifer,Least Concern,NA,2019,2019-02-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>A widespread species with no known major widespread threats, it is assessed as Least Concern. &#160;&#160; </p>","This species inhabits coastal waters, estuaries and lagoons, including brackish waters.<br/><br/>It is a coastal and estuarine species that is semi-catadromous, with some individuals either remaining in marine or estuarine waters throughout life, while others penetrate long distances into freshwater nurseries.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>Barramundi are opportunistic predators; crustaceans and fish predominate in the diet of adults (Larson 1999). Juveniles also consume insects (Allen<em> et al.</em> 1999). It is mostly found over soft bottom, hard bottom and rocky substrate (Allen <em>et al. </em>2002); they are also reported to frequent coral reefs (Nguyen and Nguyen 2006). In fresh water habitats, Barramundi prefer&#160;cover on undercut banks, submerged logs and overhanging vegetation&#160;(Allen<em> et al. </em>2002).<br/><br/><em>Lates calcarifer</em> is known to be a protandrous hermaphrodite in Australia (Moore 1979),&#160;but sex change in Asian populations of this species is less well defined and primary females are common. Females are generally absent in the smaller length classes, but dominate larger length classes. Most Barramundi mature first as males and function as males for one or more spawning seasons before undergoing sex inversion. A few females will develop directly from immature fish (Davis 1987). Similarly, some males may never undergo sex inversion (Davis 1987). Length at first maturity for males in Australia is between 29 and 60 cm and an unsexed individual in the Indo-Pacific measured 90 cm.<br/><br/>Spawning seasonality varies within the range of this species.&#160;Barramundi are broadcast spawners that aggregate to spawn (Kailola<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1993).&#160;Barramundi in northern Australia spawn between September and March, with latitudinal variation in spawning season, presumably in response to varying water temperatures (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Philippines, Barramundi spawn from late June to late October, while in Thailand spawning is associated with the monsoon season, with two peaks during the northeast monsoon (August – October) and the southwest monsoon (February – June) (Buschmann<em> et al.</em> 1996). Spawning occurs near river mouths, in the lower reaches of estuaries, or around coastal headlands (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 1986), and sometimes in the tidal flats near river mouths (Kailola<em> et al.</em> 1993). Barramundi spawn after the full and new moons during the spawning season, and spawning activity is usually associated with incoming tides that apparently assist transport of eggs and larvaer into the estuary (Bushcmann <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160;<br/><br/>While adults and juveniles are capable of living in fresh water, brackish waters are required for embryonic development (Shaklee and Salini 1985).&#160;Barramundi are highly fecund; a single female (120 cm TL) may produce 30–40 million eggs, or 2.3 million eggs per kg of body weight (Davis 1984). Under hatchery conditions, larvae grow to juveniles in 26 days (MacKinnon 1987).&#160;The postlarvae (and possibly larvae) move from spawning areas to brackish water seasonal habitat (Russell and Garrett 1985). Larval Barramundi occupy these habitats as well as main channels of streams (Kailola<em> et al. </em>1993). Juveniles live in freshwater lagoons, swamps and creeks (Russell and Garett 1985). As these temporary habitats dry up, the juveniles move into the main stream and many migrate upstream to permanent freshwater habitats (Kailola <em>et al.</em> 1993).&#160;Juvenile Barramundi remain in freshwater habitats until they are three–four years of age (60–70 cm TL) when they reach sexual maturity as males, and then move downstream during the breeding season to participate in spawning. Because Barramundi are euryhaline, they can be cultured in a range of salinities, from fresh to seawater. When they are six–eight years old (85–100 cm TL), Australian Barramundi change sex to female and remain female for the rest of their lives (Kailola <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/><em>Lates calcarifer</em> grows very quickly, achieving 1,500 to 3,000 g in one year (Hora and Pillay 1962). Although some Barramundi have been recorded as undertaking extensive movements between river systems, most of them remain in their original river system and move only short distances. This limited exchange of individuals between river systems is one factor that has contributed to the development of genetically distinct groups of Barramundi in northern Australia, where there are six recognised genetic strains in Queensland, and a further ten in the Northern Territory and Western Australia (FAO&#160;Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme).","<p>Loss of habitat through damming, mangrove destruction and overfishing are the key threats to the species.</p><p>There are no know threats towards this fish in The Gulf region. However, it should be noted that studies suggest that heavy aquaculture of this species is potentially leading to lower allele variation and less genetic diversity of aquacultured stocks when compared to wild-bred stocks (Yue <em>et al</em>. 2009), which breed-and-release programmes should be aware of and conduct further studies as to how this can lower genetic diversity in the wild.</p><p>A study published in 2010 showed that <em>L. calcarifer </em>fish caught off the southwestern coast of India revealed that this species has higher bioaccumulation of trace metals that other individuals of the same species inhabiting other waters in its range, and Cadmium had accumulated to toxic to human levels (Rejomon<em> et al.</em> 2010).</p>","No information is available on the population of this species across its range. The magnitude and timing of the wet season is likely to impact the juvenile success rate in this species. This is also a commercially fished species with harvest&#160; records suggesting that commercial catch peaked in 2011 (Saunders, Whybird and Newman 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><em>Lates calcarifer</em> is very well represented in museum collections, with 331 lots worldwide (FishNet2 retrieved 28 January 2014).<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea in the late 1980s, Barramundi was ranked fourth in terms of both total fish production and foreign-exchange earnings (Opnai and Tenakanai 1987). The Barramundi catch represented ~80% of the total weight of commercial seafood sold in Daru in 1995 (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the early 1970s, commercial fishing vessels and artisanal fishers landed around 330 tonnes of <em>L. calcarifer</em> per year in just the Western province of Daru, around the Fly River region. However, intense local fishing depleted the local stock to the extent that the commercial fishing enterprises shut down in 1990 due to a lack of landings, most probably occurring because of stock depletion from over fishing (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1998).",Unknown,"This species is recorded from Indo-West Pacific;&#160;eastern edge of the Persian Gulf to China, Taiwan and southern Japan, southward to southern Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. In India, it is present in coastal brackish water areas of West Bengal, Orissa. It is probably not present in southern India. It has been recorded from Myanmar and Bangladesh.<strong><br/></strong>","This is a coastal, estuarine and freshwater species, and in India much of the catch is landed in winter. It enters estuaries and backwaters in pursuit of food and shelter but always returns to marine environments for spawning. Australian commercial fisheries generally cease fishing during the wet season (summer months) but this is managed by the different states or territories (e.g. Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland).<br/><br/>Juveniles of the species frequent the lower estuarine areas in the Hooghly-Matlah river system and enter impoundments along with the tidal water which acts as the main source of seed for brackish-water fish culture in impoundments popularly known as 'Bhasabadha' fishes in west Bengal. This prime estuarine perch comes into the Chilka Lake (Orissa) as young fish and back to the sea for breeding in June/July. This species is esteemed as a food fish. The maximum size attained is 150 cm; common size 45-60 cm. The airbladders are made into rough isinglass; marketed mostly fresh.<br/><br/><em>Lates calcarifer</em> is one of&#160; northern Australia's most important commercial fish species and is one of the most popular angling species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is of huge commercial importance throughout its range as it is a very good tasting fish and it grows quickly (Larson 1999). Because of its high economic importance and commercial value, it is heavily aquacultured throughout its range,&#160;with most production in Southeast Asia, generally from small coastal cage farms. Often these farms will culture a mixture of species, including Barramundi, groupers (Family Serranidae, Subfamily Epinephelinae) and snappers (Family Lutjanidae).<br/><br/>Australia is experiencing the development of large-scale Barramundi farms that reflect the industrialized style of aquaculture seen in Europe. Where Barramundi farming is undertaken outside the tropics, recirculation production systems are often used (e.g. in southern Australia and in the north-eastern United States of America).<br/><br/>Barramundi has been introduced for aquaculture purposes to Iran, Guam, French Polynesia, the United States of America (Hawaii, Massachusetts) and Israel (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Fact Sheet).<br/><br/>It is also commercially fished throughout its range, mostly with gillnets (Larson 1999) and with rod-and-reel in recreational sport fishing (Larson 1999). Until 1990, less than 20,000 tonnes were harvested yearly, but by 1993, the landings totals doubled to over 40,000 tonnes per year. By the year 2,000, the total landings had increased to 75,000 tonnes and in 2010, the global landings had increased to over 100,000 tonnes (FAO Fisheries Statistics).&#160;<br/><br/>In The Gulf, Pakistan reported landing 600 tonnes of <em>&#160;L. calcarifer </em>and reaching 3,018 tonnes in 1982. However, in subsequent years, Pakistan's landing steadily decreased until 1999, when it reported landing just over 200 tonnes, and then Pakistan did not report landing any more of this species (FishStatJ Global Capture Statistics). Indonesia reports landing the most tonnage of this fish by far, reporting landing 12,438 tonnes in the East Indian Ocean and 85,257 tonnes from the Western-Central Pacific (FishStatJ Global Capture Statistics).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,<p>Research into the&#160;species' taxonomy is suggested as this may be a&#160;species&#160;complex.<br/></p><p>Stocks are managed in northern Australia for both recreational and commercial fishing.</p>,Australasian|Indomalayan,NA,FALSE,FALSE,Global

Juveniles of this species are common in tide pools and raft with drifting <em>Sargassum</em> and other floating objects (L.A. Rocha and R.F.

Food items include algae, small crustaceans and fish, and various invertebrate larvae (Carter 2002).  At Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, this species feeds on spinner dolphins’ faeces and vomits.  The offal feeding may be regarded as a simple behavioural shift from plankton feeding to drifting offal picking.  Also, juveniles may hold cleaning stations together with the Doctorfish (<em>Acanthurus chirurgus</em>) and the Blue Tang (<em>Acanthurus coeruleus</em>) and graze algae as well as pick moulted skin and parasites from Green Turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>).  This behaviour is preceded by a characteristic inspection usually followed by feeding nips on the turtles’ skin (head, limbs, and tail), as well as on the carapace. The most inspected and cleaned body parts are the flippers (Sazima <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>It is a territorial species. Adult males adopt a bluish ground colour when guarding eggs.

It can be harvested particularly by commercial, recreational or artisanal fishers in most areas but typically in relatively small numbers. It is one of the most common shallow reef fishes in the Greater Caribbean. There are no known major threats at the global scale. It is listed as Least Concern.","<em>Haemulon flavolineatum </em>occurs in large schools on rocky and coral reefs to depths of 60 m. This species settles in shallow waters in a variety of structural habitat types including hardbottom and vegetated habitats. Juveniles exhibit a pattern of diel migration from protective resting sites on coral reefs during the day to night-time feeding grounds of seagrass beds and other soft bottom habitats such as sand and mud (Ogden and Ehrlich 1977). Juveniles school during the day at coral reef and other hard bottom habitats then disperse around dusk to feed solitarily throughout the night (Helfman <em>et al</em>. 1982). Dispersal distances for juveniles are suspected to range from tens to hundreds of metres (Ogden and Ehrlich 1977), although few direct measurements of this distance have been conducted. A study on the pattern of habitat utilization in <em>H. flavolineatum</em> by Kendall <em>et al.</em> (2003) indicated that both juvenile and adult were found primarily over hard bottom substrates during the day. Juveniles were primarily found in lagoon areas as indicated by Ogden and Erlich (1977). However, adults were also more likely to be found in lagoons, not offshore as was previously speculated (Ogden and Erlich 1977).&#160;Juveniles can show fidelity to daytime sites across periods between 47 and 425 days, even though these sites are located in extensive and spatially continuous back-reef habitats. Furthermore, part of the population sheltering in shoreline shelter habitats (mangroves and rocky shoreline) during daytime move to adjacent seagrass beds in the afternoon (after 11:45am), likely to start feeding in seagrasses during daylight. Populations probably continue feeding here during night time, away from the daytime shelter sites, but in the morning of the next day, most fishes return to exactly the same shoreline shelter sites as those of the previous day (Verweij and Nagelkerken 2007).&#160;Pelagic larval duration lasts an average of 14 days (Brothers and McFarland 1981, McFarland <em>et al</em>. 1985) at which time larvae settle into sand or seagrass habitats (Shulman 1985a) or onto reef structures (McFarland <em>et al</em>. 1985) and begin their benthic life. Juveniles in seagrass or sand habitats migrate to reefs within first month of settlement (Shulman 1985). Seagrass beds are an important nursery biotype for juveniles of this species but appear to utilize mangrove and seagrass nursery biotypes simultaneously (Nagelkerken <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Caribbean, grunts usually settle into seagrass beds, then move onto reefs several weeks later (McFarland 1979). They also can settle abundantly on hardbottom habitats in shallower depth zones (Lindeman and Snyder 1999, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;In Barbados, seagrass beds are scarce, and grunt juveniles generally settle directly onto reefs (Tupper 1989). Newly settled grunts remain closely associated with the substrate for one to two weeks, but as they grow they forage farther from the reef (Tupper and Juanes 1999). Food items include plankton from settlement until 3-4 cm (SL), then benthic invertebrates for adults (Helfman <em>et al. </em>1982, McFarland pers. comm. in Shulman and Ogden 1987). Mangroves and seagrass beds provide daytime feeding habitats for some life-stages of <em>H. flavolineatum,</em> which is generally considered a nocturnal feeder (Verweij <em>et al</em>. 2006). The juvenile usage of several backreef habitats in comparison to congeners is reviewed in Nagelkerken (2009).&#160;Sexual maturity is attained at 12-15 cm (SL) (Billings and Munro 1974). Spawning has not been observed in this species and spawning behaviours and frequencies are not known (Shulman and Ogden 1987). However, spawning has been reported throughout the year off Jamaica and in the northeastern Caribbean, where individuals in spawning condition have been observed in March and September (Erdman 1976, NMFS 2005). In a portion of Tague Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, mean annual recruitment was recorded at 1.8 recruits per m<sup>2</sup> of lagoon floor, equivalent to 44 recruits per m2 of juvenile habitat per year and among the highest recruitment rates reported for reef fishes. Post-settlement mortality was also very high: during the first month of benthic life it was 0.9 and during the first year was &gt;0.992 (Shulman and Ogden 1987). Recruits can distinguish between water types from different habitats and show a preference for water from seagrass beds and mangroves over that from the coral reef (Huijbers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Maximum total length for this species is 30 cm (Robins and Ray 1986).","Due to the absence of directed fisheries and the exceptional frequency and abundance of this species, there are few major direct threats to this species. A study conducted by Hawkins and Roberts (2004) to determine the effects of artisanal fishing to fish assemblages and benthic communities in six islands in the Caribbean (where fishing pressures ranged from non-existent in Bonaire to very high intensities in Jamaica) showed grunt biomass did not decrease as fishing pressure increased, although biomass differed significantly among the islands. It has been identified as a prey item of the invasive Lionfish, <em>Pterois volitans </em>(Valdez-Moreno <em>et al</em>. 2012, Green and Cote 2014). Adults of the species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<em>Haemulon flavolineatum</em> is very abundant in many parts of its range. Several of many examples follow. <em>Haemulon flavolineatum</em> was the second most abundant species to colonize artificial reefs within the Looe Key Special Protected Area from May 2001 to August 2002 (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species is very common off many areas of Mexico (M. Vega-Cendejas pers. comm. 2013). This species was the most frequently encountered grunt, occurring in 35% of the total surveys, and represented the greatest grunt biomass inside the Virgin Island Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM) (Monaco<em> et al</em>. 2007). At the VICRNM, mean <em>H. flavolineatum</em> biomass was 27% greater outside compared with inside from 2002-2004. It is the most abundant species recorded in Lamarka Reef, Nicaragua (WWF USAID-CAFTA 2009) and is also very abundant in Venezuela (Cervigon 1993). French Grunt was one of five species that accounted for 77% of visual census density of trappable fish in the Barbados Marine Reserve and adjacent non-reserve area. Density estimates recorded for this species were 23.17 individuals/400 m<sup>2</sup> in the Barbados Marine Reserve and 9.70 individuals/400 m<sup>2</sup> outside the reserve (Chapman and Kramer 1999). A study by Tupper and Juanes (1999) on the effects of the Barbados Marine Reserve on the recruitment dynamics of haemulid fishes and their predators on coral reefs, showed that size and abundance of adult grunts (<em>Haemulon chrysargyreum, H. aurolineatum </em>and <em>H. flavolineatum</em>) and piscivores that prey on grunts were greater within the reserve than on adjacent reefs. Size and abundance of older juvenile grunts did not differ between protected and exploited reefs. Recruitment and early juvenile abundance were lower within the reserve and were inversely related to predator density.",Unknown,"<em>Haemulon flavolineatum</em> is distributed in the western Atlantic from South Carolina south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys and from Tuxpan, Mexico along the northern Yucatan to northwestern Cuba, and throughout the Caribbean to Trinidad.

It was covered within the New Zealand Department of Conservation's large galaxiid recovery plan 2003-2013. However, it is listed as 'Not Threatened' in the national Department of Conservation's listings and is considered of low conservation priority with no species specific actions required. Considering the stabilization of population trend along with the plasticity in life history (ability to form land locked or marine derived populations, plus high recruitment capabilities), this species is assessed as Least Concern.","<em>G. fasciatus</em>&#160;is a large, amphidromous galaxiid (with females reaching up to 300 mm in length), which also readily forms land-locked populations in lakes. It&#160;is typically found at low-mid elevations in pools of small forested streams where there is good cover from overhanging vegetation, banks, boulders and woody debris (McDowall 1990). Males mature at 2 years of age while females mature at 4 years (Hopkins 1979a,b). Specimens are commonly found up to 200 mm (McDowall 1990), which are likely to be about 7 years of age based on average growth rates (Hopkins 1979a). This is likely to be the typical intergeneration time of this species, assuming this is the common adult length and growth rate.&#160;<em>G. fasciatus </em>can often reach up to 260 mm (McDowall 1990), which are likely to be around 10 years old. Individuals are however likely to reach older ages given that West <em>et al.</em> (2005) found one specimen that may have been up to 15 years of age. This is the oldest known specimen and is likely to be close to the maximum lifespan of this species. Spawning occurs from autumn/early winter close to typical adult habitats. Eggs have been observed to be deposited terrestrially during high water events, hatching after re-inundation (<span style="""">Mitchell and Penlington 1982)</span>. Larvae rear in estuaries or at sea and return to freshwater after 4-6 months as whitebait. This species is a skilled climber at whitebait stage and is able to migrate up substantial waterfalls (NIWA 2013,<span style="""">&#160;Mitchell and Penlington, 1982</span>). Like other large galaxiids,&#160;<em>G. fasciatus </em>feeds primarily opportunistically on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and occasionally feeding on small fish (West <em>et al</em>. 2005, Department of Conservation 2005, McDowall 2000).","Several common causes of decline have been implicated in the general range contraction and decrease in abundance of large galaxiids. These include overharvesting of the juvenile whitebait stage, artificial barriers to migration, habitat destruction, pollution of waterways, changes in catchment land use and the impacts of introduced species (Department of Conservation 2005). The primary threat to this species is thought to be the loss and degradation of adult habitat through deforestation and other land use changes, which have impacted their preferred native forest stream habitats. Loss of wetlands is also likely to have negatively affected the distribution of this species. It is considered that partial obstruction and/or complete loss of fish passage due to artificial barriers (particularly undercut culverts and hydro dams that disrupt river connectivity and access to adult habitats), in many regions has also negatively affected the distribution of this species. There is a potential threat of predation and competition by introduced salmonids, primarily Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>)<em>.&#160;</em>Furthermore, the loss of riparian vegetation impacts on spawning success, is likely to change water temperatures and reduce the availability of terrestrial food supply (Department of Conservation 2005, McDowall 2000).","Historically, the population of this species has undergone substantial declines in range and abundance, particularly in developed areas such as the Manawatu and Canterbury plains (with loss of habitat through forest clearance) and with the introduction of invasive predatory fish species (such as Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>)). Currently, there is a gap in the distribution of this species, between Banks Peninsula and Otago Peninsula on the east coast, but this is probably due to a lack of typical habitat.

Hybridisation is already occurring throughout the northern part of the species' range, with most of the evidence coming from the Limpopo River System. In terms of locations the threat of Nile Tilapia is widespread, at least 30% of the locations have been affected by hybridisation in the past, and further impacts are projected in future that would result in more than 30% rapid population reduction. The species has an estimated generation length of seven years, and the observed reduction in population size has taken place recently, at least in the last 14 years.

There also appears to be some confusion over whether or not forested habitats are utilized by the species (Lemckert 1996; Gillespie 1996). Pyke and White (1996) examined sites where <em>L. aurea</em> is known to have been present, and compared the habitat at sites where breeding was identified with that at locations where breeding was not identified, in New South Wales. Sites which supported breeding populations were found to contain waterbodies which are still, shallow, ephemeral, unpolluted, unshaded, with aquatic plants and generally free of <em>Gambusia</em> and other predatory fish (but not always); adjacent terrestrial habitats consisted of grassy areas and vegetation no higher than woodlands, and a range of diurnal shelter sites. Breeding occurred in a significantly higher proportion of sites with ephemeral ponds rather than sites with fluctuating or permanent ponds, and where predatory fish were absent. Mahony (1999) commented on the limitations of the study and suggested that the results do not necessarily identify the requirements of the species prior to declines. It is worthy to note that the use of ephemeral breeding sites was not a feature associated with members of the bell frog group in earlier habitat descriptions (Mahony 1999). Pyke and White (1996) suggest that the habitat requirements of <em>L. aurea</em> in New South Wales and Victoria differ. In New South Wales the species occupies disturbed habitats and breeding largely occurs in ephemeral ponds (Pyke and White 1996). However, in Victoria it occupies habitats with little human disturbance and commonly breeds in permanent ponds as well as ephemeral ponds (Pyke and White 1996). Goldingay (1996) argued that this is because most natural habitats are degraded or lost in New South Wales. In Victoria the species is predominantly found on the coastal plains and low foothills of the hinterland where it has been recorded in a range of lentic and terrestrial habitats (Gillespie 1996). Breeding has been documented from dams in both forested and cleared areas, swamps in farmland, gravel pits, billabongs, marshes, coastal lagoon wetlands, wet swale herb lands and isolated stream-side pools (Gillespie 1996). These habitats are mostly permanent, but include some ephemeral waterbodies (Gillespie 1996). All habitats are characterized by stationary water (Gillespie 1996). Virtually all isolated waterbodies are free of native fish species and typically have dense emergent vegetation (Gillespie 1996). It can be found in a variety of terrestrial habitats including lowland forest, banksia woodland, wet heath land, riparian scrub complex, riparian shrubland, riparian forest, damp forest, shrubby dry forest and cleared pastoral lands (Gillespie 1996). It is seasonally active and has been observed from September to early May (Daly 1995). Males call between September and March. Spawn is laid amongst aquatic vegetation and has been observed in December, January and February (Daly 1995). Counts of eight egg masses ranged from 2,463-11,682 eggs (van de Mortel and Goldingay 1998). Eggs hatch within three days and metamorphosis can take from 2-11 months (Daly 1995); however, six weeks appears to be an average duration for the field (R. Goldingay pers. comm.).","The cause(s) of the apparent declines observed in populations of all taxa within the <em>L. aurea</em> complex are unclear (Gillespie, Osborne and McElhinney 1995). Investigations of disappearances among the group have primarily focused on <em>L. aurea</em> and <em>L. castanea</em> and two major directions in research have been pursued: the role of increased ultraviolet radiation; and the impact of the introduced fish, <em>Gambusia</em> (Mahony 1999). It is also possible that disease, such as a viral infection or chytrid fungus, might have contributed to the decline of this species (W. Osborne pers. comm.). Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Hoskinstown and Homebush Bay in Sydney, New South Wales.","This species was formerly considered to be common throughout its range (Tyler 1992). Since about 1960, declines in the distribution and abundance of the species have been observed to the extent that it may now be regarded as rare (White and Pyke 1996). In New South Wales, the species has disappeared completely from all highland areas above 250m asl and coastal populations have been reduced in number and are more isolated from other populations (White and Pyke 1996). Osborne, Littlejohn and Thomson (1996) observed that the species had declined in the Australian Capital Territory and had not been recorded from the Southern Tablelands since 1980. Declines in abundance have been observed in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (White and Pyke 1996; Osborne, Littlejohn and Thomson 1996; Lewis and Goldingay 1999; Goldingay and Lewis 1999), although no similar decline in distribution and abundance in Victoria is so far apparent (Gillespie 1996). Recent censuses of populations throughout the distribution of the species indicate that many are small, with most estimates being less than 20 adults (White and Pyke 1996). In New Zealand, where the species has been introduced, there are many thousands of individuals, but local declines have been observed with chytridiomycosis and introduced <em>Gambusia</em> fish being implicated.",Decreasing,"This Australian species has been recorded along the south-east coast from East Gippsland in Victoria, north to approximately Byron Bay in north-east New South Wales (Gillespie 1996; White and Pyke 1996). Most records are from elevations below 100m asl. North of Sydney, there were a few high-elevation records of the species and almost all records were east of the Great Divide (the only discrepant records are from Armidale and Ebor) (White and Pyke 1996). On the Southern Tablelands, the species does not appear to occur above 800m asl (Osborne, Littlejohn and Thomson 1996) and in Victoria the species does not appear to occur above about 670m asl (Gillespie 1996). Populations occur on two offshore islands in New South Wales, Bowen Island in Jervis Bay (Osborne and McElhinney 1996) and Broughton Island north of Port Stephens (New South Wales NPWS Atlas 1998). It remains unknown whether or not these populations are relictual or the result of assisted translocation (Mahony 1999). It has been introduced to New Zealand and is widespread across northern North Island, and pet traders have moved it between the North and South Islands.

L.v. alpina occurs mainly in woodland, heath, grassland and herb field at montane, sub alpine and alpine altitudes (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 1995). Breeding populations occur on plains or open valleys where there are stream side pools, fens and bogs (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 1995) but are also be associated with artificial waterbodies such as small dams and reservoirs (e.g. four of the seven extant populations of L. v. alpina located in Kosciuszko NP) (Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1999).

Populations predominantly feeding on detritus are often stunted (stunted populations may also be associated with strong year classes). May shift from littoral to pelagic habitats and between benthic food and zooplankton when abundance of a specific food item is high or in order to avoid predation and/or competition. The decision whether to stay in open water or among littoral vegetation is often described as a trade-off between food uptake and predator avoidance. When growing, there is an energetic need to switch from zooplankton to benthic food (chironomids, molluscs). Individuals able to feed on Dreissena mussels increase their growth rate but do not exploit this food source until they have reached about 120 mm SL (at which size they are able to crush the mussels).

Spawns in rivers and streams with swift water. Lacustrine populations migrate to tributaries and lake outlets, rarely spawning on stone, wave-washed lake shores. Spawning sites usually characterised by downward movement of water into gravel. Sea and lake trouts forage in pelagic and littoral habitats, sea trouts mostly close to coast, not very far from estuary of natal river. <br/><br/><strong>Biology</strong>: <br/>Anadromous, lacustrine and resident ecotypes. Spawns in couples between late October and March, usually in November-December. Females select spawning sites and deposit the redd. Males guard and defend females against other males. Eggs are covered with gravel by female. Both sexes usually survive spawning and anadromous trout migrate back to sea or lake in autumn or overwinter in rivers and migrate in spring (5-70 % repetitive spawners in Norway). Sea trouts generally feed in freshwater. Eggs are covered with 3-30 cm of gravel. Redd depth is positively related to female's size. Eggs in deep redds are less vulnerable to spates and wash-outs and more vulnerable to low oxygen concentrations and pollution. Fry usually emerge from gravel between March (Spain) and July (Finland). Parrs and resident trouts are territorial, feeding on drifting and benthic invertebrates. Success in finding and defending a feeding territory is positively correlated to size of fry and to mother's size. Being large is clearly advantageous at this stage of life cycle. Resident trouts usually spawn for the first time at 2-3 years and spawn 2-3 seasons. Smoltification usually complete at 2-3 years and 120-220 mm SL, but up to seven year old smolts are reported. Mean smolt age increases with latitude. All juveniles seem to have the genetic ability to smoltify and migrate; in some small, summer-dry streams all migrate. In other streams, almost none seem to migrate. Factors triggering the 'decision' of an individual to smoltify or not are not well understood. If migration is impossible, smolts may interrupt migration and become resident again. In most rivers, a greater proportion of females than males seems to migrate, apparently a response to a greater need for reproductive energy. Therefore, sex ratio is usually skewed towards females in smolts. Large anadromous females may spawn with small resident males (the reverse is not reported but is expected to be possible, too). Smolts start to migrate downstream in April-May when temperature increases from low winter level, reaching beyond 5-11°C; migration peaks at rising water levels with increased turbidity.<br/><br/>There is a great variability in life history details of lacustrine populations. In some lakes, fry may migrate to the lake and at least males may spawn for the first time at two years. In other lakes, parrs smoltify after spending 1-3 years in spawning streams and males feed 4-6, females 5-8 years before first reproduction. At sea and in lakes, trouts feed on small fish and large crustaceans. In lakes, aquatic and terrestrial insects may form an important part of the diet. After at least 18 month at sea, sea trouts start to return to rivers to spawn. The pattern and timing of upstream migrations depends on particular river, sex and age. Homing accuracy is not as high as in <em>S. salar</em>. After spending one summer at sea, whitling start to migrate in July-September to lower reaches of rivers to overwinter or mature and migrate to spawning sites. Anadromous adults migrate in May and enter rivers until late October. Most maturing whitlings are males and the proportion of whitlings might be up to 30 % among spawners. Whitlings usually sneak in to spawn in redds of large couples, as resident males do, too. Large males attack, injure and often kill sneakers. After one spawning season as whitling or resident male, individual trouts may spawn again as large sea trout. The factors triggering the 'choice' to reproduce as whitling or as large male seems to be related to body size of young parrs since larger parrs more frequently develop the whitling tactic and smaller parrs the large male tactic. During upriver migrations, the silvery colour evolves into a dark breeding colour, the skull of males enlarges and the lower jaw develops a kype.

It also inhabits dry equatorial forests. It thrives in degraded habitats and man-made environments, and is occasionally found in pristine lowland and montane rainforests, but generally prefers open or disturbed habitat such as tracks, roads, low grassland and areas that are near human settlement, e.g. grazing land, suburban parks and gardens. It tends to avoid more densely vegetated areas (eg. wet sclerophyll and rainforest), which can then act as a barrier to their dispersal. It can be found by day beneath fallen trees, loose boards, matted coconut leaves, and similar cover (Lynn 1940). It feeds on arthropods (especially ants and termites) and small vertebrates. It is flexible regards breeding site (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1996); eggs and larvae develop in slow or still shallow waters of ponds, ditches, temporary pools, reservoirs, canals, and streams.

Historically the two species were harvested commercially for flesh and caviar, but no species differentiation was recorded in the landings data. <br/> <br/>Although some shortnose sturgeon may still be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are habitat related resulting from loss or degradation. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).   <br/> <br/>Shortnose Sturgeon stocks appear to be stable and even increasing in a few large rivers but remain seriously depressed in others, particularly southern populations. Previous Red Lists listed the species as Vulnerable. Since that earlier listing, a Recovery Plan has been developed and is being implemented and genetically distinct population segments have been identified. Although exploitation is no longer a serious concern, effects of habitat alteration and degradation and water quality (contaminant) concerns remain. Thus, the shortnose sturgeon should continue to receive a Vulnerable listing. This is based, in part, on an estimated population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations with some irreversible habitat losses and continued concern about impacts of pollutants and water-based development activities on population health. We also note extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals between rivers, from a few hundred or less in the Chesapeake Bay to perhaps 10,000 or more in the Hudson.","Shortnose sturgeon use of saltwater is generally amphidromous throughout most of the species' range, although far northern populations are anadromous (Kynard 1997). Spawning takes place in upper freshwater areas, while feeding (summering) and wintering occurs in both fresh and saline environments. This species typically spends its entire life history in the natal river and estuary and only rarely moves any great distance in near-coastal marine waters. There are no naturally land-locked populations of the species, but two rivers have populations that are segmented by dams.
<br/>
<br/>This species typically attains an adult size of 75–100 cm total length, though the maximum recorded size for a Canadian-caught female was 1.43 m and 23.6 kg (Dadswell <em>et al</em>. 1984).  Maximum ages determined for female and male shortnose sturgeon (again in Canada) were 67 and 32 years, respectively (Vladykov and Greeley 1963).  Prespawning migrations in northern populations are triggered by increasing water temperatures of 7–10°C, and during spawning, males are attracted to females by a female pheromone (Kynard and Horgan 2002a).  Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 7–15°C.  Spawning habitat is a substrate of rock or large gravel (usually rubble), and water depth during spawning is highly variable. Spawning suitability windows follow day length of 13.9–14.9 h, water temperature of 6.5–15°C, and river discharge that provides 30–120 cm/sec (mean 70 cm/sec) bottom velocity. All spawning windows must be open simultaneously for spawning to occur. Yearling shortnose sturgeon initiate the major dispersal that moves young fish to join older juveniles and adults in fresh or salt water foraging concentration areas. Yearling and older juveniles use the same summering and wintering habitats as adults (Kynard <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>In southern waters, shortnose males may mature in 2-3 years and females in 4-6 years. In northern portions of the range, maturation may not occur for 10-15 years (maximum). Spawning periodicity is poorly understood but in the northern part of the range, females are highly variable (2-9 years) and males spawn at 1-5 year intervals depending on fish age and foraging conditions. Some males in northern populations spawn annually.","Although some shortnose sturgeon may be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are blockage of up- and downstream migrations at dams, habitat loss or degradation due to dams and dam operations, river channel dredging, and pollution. Southern populations are particularly at risk due to water withdrawal from rivers and groundwaters and from eutrophication that directly degrades river water quality causing loss of habitat. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).","The estimate of the total current population size for the Hudson River indicates a 95% confidence interval of 26,000 to 55,000 individuals. The Saint John, Kennebec, and Delaware subpopulations appear to be on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 fish each. Estimates of other northern populations are the Connecticut River (CT-MA) — about 1,200 fish, and the Merrimack River (MA) of less than 100 individuals (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997, Savoy 2004). Though many rivers in the southern region have been documented to contain shortnose sturgeon, few have had population estimates conducted. Only abundance in the Ogeechee and Altamaha rivers of Georgia have been estimated and both appear to be on the order of 1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Shortnose sturgeon occur only rarely in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and no breeding population has been confirmed here.
<br/>
<br/>Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2001) analyzed shortnose sturgeon populations from two drainages in Maine and the Hudson River for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences between the Kennebec and Androscoggin stocks and even greater separation when compared to the Hudson stock. These data support the putative stock structure and distinct population segment designation adopted for shortnose sturgeon.",Decreasing,"Shortnose sturgeons occur in many of the large coastal rivers of eastern North America. From survey and tagging data, the National Marine Fisheries Service now recognizes 19 distinct population segments. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery Team considered sturgeon populations from two general regions, northern rivers and southern rivers. The largest populations in the northern region appear to be in the Saint John, NB, Canada (Dadswell 1979), Delaware, NJ-PA (Hastings <em>et al</em>. 1987), Kennebec, ME (Squiers <em>et al</em>. 1982), and Hudson, NY rivers (Bain <em>et al</em>. 1995).  <br/> <br/>See the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.natureserve.org/explorer/%E2%80%9C"">NatureServe Explorer</a> database for a more detailed description of this species’ range.",NA,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The shortnose sturgeon was listed as endangered under the inaugural U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1967. At that time, very little information was available regarding life history and behavior of this species. Since then, considerable work has been accomplished to determine habitats and migrations important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment, use of fish passage and fish protection structures, and fish culture. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery and Management Plan (NMFS 1998) identifies recovery actions that would help to establish population levels that would allow de-listing of the shortnose sturgeon. <br/> <br/>Captive broodstock and several generations of progeny are currently being held at federal fish hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and at a research laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey.

This fish is most abundant in quiet water near edges of pools, particularly where there are minimal growths of algae (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980). Springs are typically quite hard, with high levels of silica, sulphates, and chlorides (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980). Permanent water exists as two semi-isolated reaches in Leon Creek, which originates in seeps and flows 1 km to join another 1-km-long outflow from Diamond-Y Spring; a combined permanent flow then passes another&#160;kilometre&#160;or so and percolates into the ground; the channel then becomes ill-defined and dry for about 2 km, then water reenters from seeps and springs to form a second 2.7-km reach of perennial flow that ends in two livestock watering tanks; the extent of water in this system varies with climatic conditions; salt encrustations are common along the banks, which are vegetated by sedges and other low marshland plants (Minckley <em>et al</em>. 1991).

Populations are concentrated mainly in the lower Delta and upper Suisun Bay after breeding (at least formerly). Adequate freshwater flows are needed to transport young to rearing habitat and to maintain rearing habitat in a favourable location (i.e., Suisun Bay). <br/><br/>Spawning occurs in freshwater (sometimes in slightly brackish water), primarily in tidal dead-end sloughs and channel edgewaters. Eggs are demersal and adhesive. Larvae are buoyant and are carried downstream until they reach the mixing zone; area of the 2 ppt isohaline is an important rearing habitat for the young. See USFWS (1996) and Moyle (2002).","The decline may be attributable to the Delta Smelt's low fecundity and one-year lifespan, in combination with changes and fluctuations in the estuarine ecosystem. These changes and fluctuations include: reduction in outflows (water projects have allowed the intrusion of higher salinity water into the Delta, restricting the smelt's spawning and nursery areas to less favourable river channel habitat and making them more vulnerable to diversion in massive water project pumping plants); entrainment losses of larvae and adults to water diversion (attempts to rescue entrained smelt are probably largely unsuccessful, as these fishes are relatively fragile and often die when trapped and transported); high outflows during years with unusually high rainfall (flush smelt and their food resources out of the system; may make it easier for exotic species of copepods, clams and fishes to colonize); and changes in food resources (e.g., increased abundance of various species of exotic copepods, which could deplete smelt food resources and/or be more difficult for smelt to capture; the introduced clam, <em>Potamocorbula</em>, now abundant in Suisun Bay, may reduce availability of zooplankton to smelt larvae; the diatom <em>Melosira</em>, which is difficult for zooplankton to consume, sometimes becomes very abundant in the Delta) (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989; Moyle 2002; USFWS 1993, 1996).<br/><br/>Hybridization (e.g., introduced <em>Hypomesus nipponensis</em> represents a potential threat through hybridization and/or competition; hybrids may be sterile but interbreeding may result in loss of Delta Smelt gametes).<br/><br/>Water pollution (toxic substances from agriculture and urbanization) poses a threat of unknown degree (California Department of Fish and Game 1990, Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>USFWS (Federal Register, 6 January 1994) listed the following activities as potential threats to critical habitat: sand and gravel excavation in river channels or marshes; diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement of dredged materials on levees or banks; operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and bridge and marina construction.<br/><br/>In reviewing the status of the Delta Smelt, USFWS (2004) made the following conclusions. Threats posed by extreme outflow conditions, the operations of the state and federal water projects, and other water diversions as described in the original listing (USFWS 1993) remain. Although some conservation measures have helped to ameliorate threats from adverse hydrological conditions and water diversions, it is unclear how effective these will continue to be over time based on available funding and future demands for water. Increases in water demands are likely to result in less suitable rearing conditions for Delta Smelt in Suisun Marsh, increased vulnerability to entrainment, and less water available for maintaining favourable habitat conditions. The importance of exposure to toxic chemicals on the population of Delta Smelt is highly uncertain. Threats posed by disease and predation have not been sufficiently studied, and their effects on Delta Smelt remain poorly known. Hybridization with <em>Hypomesus nipponensis</em> appears not to be a major threat. Existing regulatory mechanisms, particularly relating to water management and its affect on smelt habitat, are inadequate to assure the long-term existence of Delta Smelt in Suisun Bay and the Delta (USFWS 2004).  The only new information concerning the Delta Smelt's population size and extinction probability indicates that the population is at risk of falling below an effective population size and therefore in danger of becoming extinct.<br/><br/>An updated status review (USFWS 2010) yielded the following conclusions: Destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat poses a current and future threat. Operation of upstream reservoirs, increased water exports, and upstream diversions have altered the location and extent of the low-salinity zone, concentrating smelt in an area with competing fish species. Upstream reservoirs and the increased presence of the exotic submerged aquatic plant <em>Egeria densa</em> have also reduced turbidity levels in rearing habitat, which may reduce foraging efficiency. Predation is probably a low-level threat at this time. The continued decline in apparent abundance suggests that existing regulatory mechanisms, as currently implemented, are not adequate to reduce the threats to the species. Other threats includes entrainment by water export facilities and into power plant diversions, contaminants, and small population effects.","This species is represented by what can be regarded as one large occurrence (e.g., see Trenham <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but is much larger than 10,000. Population size fluctuates and is very difficult to estimate (Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>Historically, this was the most abundant pelagic fish in the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (Erikkila <em>et al</em>. 1950), and it remained abundant in California Department of Fish and Game trawl surveys in the Delta during the early 1970s (Stevens and Miller 1983, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 1990). Now the species is much less numerous. In the early 1990s, the delta smelt was under a high degree of threat from the severe 1987-1992 drought. The species persisted in small numbers and rebounded to pre-decline levels in 1993, suggesting that recovery potential is fairly high. However, the subsequent decline in 1994, a critical water year, to a then all-time low annual abundance index, illustrates the high degree of threat that neutralizes gains in abundance that result from good water years. USFWS (2004) concluded that although there has been a general increase in numbers since the low point during a long period of drought in the 1980s and early 1990s, delta smelt abundance has not recovered to its pre-decline (prior to 1982) levels and that the overall trend is negative. USFWS (2010) found a continuing steep decline.<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations (three generations is a shorter time period than 10 years) has been a steep decline. Apparent abundance has continued to decline since the significant decline that occurred in 2002; the most recent fall mid-water trawl abundance index (2009) was the lowest ever recorded (less than one-tenth the level of 2003) (USFWS 2010). A 2005 population viability analysis calculated a 50 percent likelihood that the species could reach effective extinction within 20 years (see USFWS 5-year review summarized in 2010).",Decreasing,"This fish is endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary, principally the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (primarily below Isleton in the Sacramento River [probably formerly north to Sacramento], and below Mossdale in the San Joaquin River) and Suisun Bay (California Department of Fish and Game 1990, Moyle 2002). The species congregates in upper Suisun Bay and occurs in small numbers in larger sloughs of Suisun Marsh when river outflows are high (mainly March to mid-June); in 1994-1998, delta smelt were found mainly in Suisun Bay (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989, Moyle 2002). During periods of drought, the&#160;centre&#160;of abundance has been in the northwestern Delta in the channel of the Sacramento River, and the species is then rare in Suisun Bay (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989, Moyle 2002). During years with average or high outflow, smelt may concentrate prior to spawning movements anywhere from the Sacramento River near Decker Island to Suisun Bay (Moyle 2002). Spawning occurs in the sloughs and channels of the upper Delta (e.g., Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs) and in the Sacramento River above Rio Vista (Moyle 2002); in some years spawning also occurs north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries or in the Napa River estuary (Federal Register, 6 January 1994; Moyle 2002). It is unclear if smelt in the Napa River are self perpetuating or if frequent recolonization from the Delta is necessary to maintain a population there (USFWS 2004). Larvae have been recorded from the Sacramento River as far north as its confluence with the Feather River (Wang 1991, cited in Federal Register 6 January 1994). Sometimes individuals are washed into San Pablo Bay, but permanent populations do not exist there (Moyle 2002).",NA,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The primary conservation need is recovery of natural processes in the Sacramento-San Francisco estuary, including outflow (Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>Moyle <em>et al</em>. (1989) emphasized that present mechanisms that regulate freshwater flow through the Delta have been inadequate to protect Delta Smelt. They concluded that the key conservation action needed is to provide enough outflow through the Delta to ensure that the entrapment zone is located in Suisun Bay during March-May in all but the driest years; this zone should not be located outside Suisun Bay for more than two successive years; such a flow regime would also benefit other species such as the striped bass.

Distribution appears to be severely fragmented.","Habitat includes permanent, flowing, unpolluted water of low gradient streams having pool, riffle, run, and backwater areas; sand, gravel, and cobble substrates with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and substrate embeddedness; abundant aquatic insects; natural hydrologic conditions, including recurrent flooding; few or no predatory or competitive non-native species present; a healthy riparian community; and moderate to high bank stability (USFWS, Federal Register, 8 March 1994; USFWS 1999). In larger rivers, Spikedace often are found in the vicinity of tributary mouths. Adults favour slow to swift velocities (0–100 cm/sec) in shallow water (3-38 cm) with shear zones where rapid flow borders slower flow, areas of sheet flow at the upper ends of mid-channel sand/gravel bars, and eddies at downstream riffle edges. Juveniles favour slow to moderate flow (0–60 cm/sec) in shallow water (3–70 cm) with moderate amounts of instream cover; shallow stream margins and backwater areas, over silt, sand, or gravel bottoms, adjacent to pools. Periodic spates that scour and clean sands and gravels are essential to feeding and reproduction (Sublette <em>et al</em>. 1990). See Barber and Minckley (1966), Anderson (1978), Propst and Bestgen (1986), Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986), and Sublette <em>et al</em>. (1990) for further details. This species may partition habitat with red shiner in areas where the two species co-occur (Rinne 1991). <br/><br/>Spawning occurs over shallow (less than 15 cm deep), sand-gravel-bottomed riffles where water flow is moderate (Minckley 1973, Sublette <em>et al</em>. 1990). Eggs develop in sand or gravel at spawning site (Sublette <em>et al</em>. 1990). Stability of the substrate is probably important during times of egg deposition and hatching (Minckley 1981). Larvae occur in areas of slow to moderate flow (0–30 cm/sec) in shallow water (3–30 cm) with abundant instream cover. <br/><br/>Habitat utilization in the Cliff-Valley reach of the Gila River was studied by Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986). Juveniles (26–35 mm TL) were found to occupy an average depth of 16.1 cm and average current speed of 16.8 cm/s. Adults (36 mm TL) in the same reach occupied an average depth of 19.3 cm and current of 49.1 cm/s. Spikedace occupied swifter waters in the warmer months of June to November than in the cooler months of December to May. Although habitat availability was not recorded, Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986) believed this to be a real shift. Sixty-percent of larval Spikedace were captured over sand-dominated substrate, 18% over gravel, and 18% over cobble substrates. Juveniles were found over gravel substrates (46%), sand-dominated substrates (45%), and cobble substrates (9%). Adults were captured over gravel substrates (47%), cobble substrates (32%), and sand-dominated substrates (19%). <br/><br/>Rinne and Kroeger (1988) observed Spikedace in Aravaipa Creek at an average depth of 20 cm and current speed of 35 cm/s over gravel and pebble substrates (3–64 mm diameter). Schools of 10 of more fish were found in deeper and slower water than solitary fish. Seasonal differences were documented in use of depths but not currents. Spikedace collected in December, February, and August occupied shallower depths than those collected in April, May, and September. Rinne and Kroeger stated these differences showed no discernible pattern and were probably related to availability.","The two primary threats  are competition with and predation by non-native aquatic species and alteration or diminishment of stream flows. These threats are persistent, and research indicates that the combination of the two is leading to Spikedace declines. The ongoing drought and climate conditions aggravate the loss of water in some areas, and future water development projects have been identified. The  opportunities for range expansion is limited by dams, reservoirs, dewatering, and non-native species distribution. Source: USFWS (2012).<br/><br/>Range and abundance have been severely reduced by habitat destruction and alteration (dam construction, stream channelization, water diversion, groundwater pumping, excessive sedimentation, destruction and alteration of riparian vegetation), and probably competition with exotic fishes (Red Shiner, <em>Cyprinella lutrensis</em>) (Douglas <em>et al</em>. 1994; USFWS, Federal Register, 8 March 1994; USFWS 1999). Introduced predatory fishes (e.g., Channel Catfish, Flathead Catfish, Green Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass) also pose a threat (Miller 1961, Minckley and Deacon 1968, FWS 1985).<br/><br/>Watershed changes and the introduction and establishment of non-native fishes occurred concurrently in the Gila River drainage, making it difficult to determine the relative importance of factors involved in the decline. However, the inverse relationship between numbers of Red Shiner and Spikedace, first identified as a potential problem in 1953 (Hubbs 1954), suggests that the Red Shiner may be a causal factor in the temporal and spatial declines of the Spikedace (Minckley 1973, 1985; Propst <em>et al</em>. 1986). In one case, in the San Francisco River, Spikedace were rare before Red Shiner became common and water diversion and low flows have been implicated in Spikedace declines (Anderson 1978, Bestgen and Propst 1987). Anderson (1978) noted an inverse relationship between numbers of Spikedace and predatory ictalurid species, which he hypothesized were important in the reduction of Spikedace. Marsh <em>et al</em>. (1989) provided direct evidence that Red Shiners displace Spikedace both in natural situations and laboratory experiments. Spikedace were displaced to areas of slower current velocities in an artificial stream with Red Shiners versus when Red Shiners were absent. In field collections, Spikedace were displaced to higher current velocities in the presence of Red Shiners versus when Red Shiners were absent. Marsh <em>et al</em>. (1989) attributed this seeming contradiction to differences in available velocities in the laboratory versus field situation.<br/><br/>The importance in retaining a natural flow regime in southwestern streams has been emphasized by Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986), Meffe and Minckley (1987), and Minckley and Meffe (1987). Native fishes usually survive flooding, whereas non-native fishes generally do not. Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986) suggested that natural flooding was also important in maintaining suitable substrate for spikedace, but there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Propst <em>et al</em>. (1986) suggested that erosion and siltation, which result in filling of interstitial spaces of gravel riffles occupied by Spikedace, may interfere with successful egg deposition and incubation and thus recruitment.","USFWS (2012) designated critical habitat in 8 units, some of which comprised separate stream segments. These could be interpreted as representing not more than 10 locations (with respect to threats, as defined by IUCN). However, the number of occurrences or locations currently with at least good viability probably does not exceed five.<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown; abundance in the occupied habitat ranges from common to very rare (USFWS 2012).<br/><br/>Present range is estimated to be about 10 percent of the historical range (USFWS 2012).<br/><br/>Data indicate that the population in New Mexico has declined in recent years (see USFWS 2012).",Decreasing,"Range includes the upper Gila River basin, Arizona and New Mexico (Page and Burr 2011). Historically, this species was common throughout much of the Verde, Agua Fria, Salt, San Pedro, San Francisco, and Gila (upstream from Phoenix) river systems (USFWS 2012); to elevations of 1800-1900 meters. Range and abundance are now much reduced. Spikedace are now restricted to portions of the upper Gila River (Grant, Catron, and Hidalgo counties, New Mexico); Aravaipa Creek (Graham and Pinal counties, Arizona); Eagle Creek (Graham and Greenlee counties, Arizona); and the Verde River (Yavapai County, Arizona) (see USFWS 2012).<br/><br/>The species is now common only in Aravaipa Creek in Arizona and one section of the Gila River south of Cliff, New Mexico. The Verde River is presumed occupied; however, the last captured fish from this river was from a 1999 survey. Spikedace from the Eagle Creek population have not been seen for over a decade, although they are still thought to exist in numbers too low for the sampling efforts to detect. The Middle Fork Gila River population is thought to be very small and has not been seen since 1991, but sampling is localized and inadequate to detect a sparse population. Source: USFWS (2012, which see for original source citations).<br/><br/>In 2007, Spikedace were translocated into Hot Springs and Redfield canyons, in Cochise County, Arizona, and these streams were subsequently augmented. Both Hot Springs and Redfield canyons are tributaries to the San Pedro River. Spikedace were also translocated into Fossil Creek, a tributary to the Verde River in Gila County, Arizona, in 2007, and were subsequently augmented in 2008 and 2011. In 2008, Spikedace were translocated into Bonita Creek, a tributary to the Gila River in Graham County, Arizona, and were repatriated to the upper San Francisco River in Catron County, New Mexico.  Augmentations with additional fish will occur for the next several years at all sites, if adequate numbers of fish are available. Monitoring at each of these sites is ongoing to determine if populations ultimately become self-sustaining. Source: USFWS (2012, which see for original source citations).<br/><br/>Extent of occurrence appears to be roughly 50,000 square kilometres, based on USFWS (2012:10922).",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Existing populations must be carefully monitored and protected by eliminating detrimental water and land use and exposure to non-native fishes. Research is needed to identify specific aspects of these practices that result in the demise of Spikedace. Spikedace are not the only native fish threatened, endangered, or extirpated from the Gila River Basin. An ecological approach that addresses the habitat needs of all native fish species is necessary to protect remaining populations of native fishes. Degraded habitat should be reclaimed and enhanced, and Spikedace should be reintroduced where chances for success are judged good.<br/><br/>Marsh (1988) suggested assessment of potential occurrences in the Gila River drainage in Sonora, Mexico, and on lands owned by the U.S. Forest Service and the San Carlos and White Mountain Apache Indian Tribes.<br/><br/>The following protection needs were identified by Marsh (1988):<ol><li>Protect existing populations (acquire water rights if necessary, protect riparian zones)</li><li>Discourage detrimental water and land use</li><li>Ensure adequate instream flows and protect or simulate natural variation in flow</li><li>Curtail transport and introduction of non-native fishes.

19034194,17875,Pogonichthys macrolepidotus,Least Concern,NA,2013,2012-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is downlisted from its previous assessment of Endangered (in 1996). Abundance declined greatly during the severe drought of 1987–1993; populations recovered dramatically under favourable conditions in 1995 and 1998. It is now listed as Least Concern in view of its large extent of occurrence, fairly large number of subpopulations and locations, lack of evidence of an ongoing decline, and lack of major threats.","Habitat includes backwaters and pools of rivers; lakes (Page and Burr 2011); slow-moving waters and dead-end sloughs of main rivers and Delta; shallow areas of bays. This species is unusually tolerant of brackish water compared to other cyprinids; it can live in waters with salinity of up to 10–18 ppt. <br/><br/>This floodplain-dependent species (Sommer <em>et al</em>. 2002) spawns over flooded vegetation in tidal freshwater and euryhaline habitats of estuarine marshes and sloughs and slow-moving reaches of large rivers. Larvae remain in shallow, weedy areas close to spawning sites and move into deeper water as they mature (Wang, 1986, cited in Federal Register, 6 January 1994). Offchannel habitats are important as nursery areas for age-0 fish (Feyrer <em>et al</em>. 2005).","<strong>HISTORICAL THREATS ASSESSMENT</strong><br/>Long-term decline was due to various interacting factors, here listed in approximate order of importance (Moyle 2002): reduction in valley floor habitats, modification of spawning habitat, changed estuarine hydraulics, especially reduced outflows, climatic variation, toxins, introduced species, and exploitation. See Moyle (2002) for details.<br/><br/>Range has been drastically reduced due to elimination or drastic alteration of habitat as a result of dams, diversions, and agricultural development (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989), including pollution from agricultural runoff, and effects of non-native aquatic animals. These factors have been exacerbated by drought and most of them still threaten extant populations. Abundance and recruitment are much reduced in dry years, when fishes have little or no access to floodplain spawning and rearing habitat (Sommer <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/><br/>Dams (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam, Nimbus Dam, Oroville Dam) block access to upstream habitats (unable to negotiate existing fishways). Proposed increases in the diversion of water from the Delta could cause a rapid decline by eliminating habitat and producing low flow conditions that are unsuitable for spawning and migration and that result in the important freshwater-saltwater entrapment zone being located unfavourably farther upstream in less productive river channels. The species is threatened also by channelization or riprapping projects that eliminate potential spawning areas in the upper Delta (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989). Recent upstream shift in distribution has exposed populations to increased mortality in water project pumps and water diversions. Probably easily disturbed while spawning. See USFWS (1999) for many further details.<br/><br/><strong>UPDATED THREATS ASSESSMENT (2010)</strong><br/>USFWS (2010) identified and evaluated the risks of the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the habitat or range of the Sacramento Splittail. The rate of habitat loss in the estuary that occurred the 1900s is no longer occurring today, and efforts undertaken in the past decade have benefited the species by restoring its habitat. There is presently sufficient habitat to maintain the species; inundation frequency and duration in key areas is sufficient to provide spawning to maintain the species. The overall effect of habitat restoration activities is expected to continue to be beneficial into the foreseeable future. USFWS (2010) found that the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of Sacramento Splittail habitat or range is not a significant threat to the Splittail now or in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Regulations enacted in March 2010 limiting take of Splittail to two individuals per day has eliminated any potential threat that fisheries may have posed (USFWS 2010). There is no indication that the current level of scientific take adversely affects the Splittail population, and there is no indication that the level of mortality will increase in the future. <br/><br/>USFWS (2010) found that disease occurs at low levels in the population but does not constitute a significant threat to the species. Predation by striped bass appears to be unchanged from past levels, is currently not a significant threat to Splittail populations, and is not expected to increase in the future. Largemouth bass populations have increased in the estuary in the past three decades, but populations of largemouth bass in critical rearing areas are low, therefore predation levels appear to be minor. <br/><br/>Federal and State regulations provide protection for the Splittail and its habitat by limiting adverse effects from new projects, restoring habitat, and limiting contaminants discharged into the estuary. Lack of regulatory mechanisms  does not constitute a significant threat to the Sacramento Splittail population now or in the foreseeable future (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>USFWS (2010) found that Splittail are not threatened by water export facilities, agricultural and power plant diversions, poor water quality, environmental contaminants, climate change, or introduced species.  <br/><br/>Natural fluctuations of population levels do not constitute an overall decline in the species, but rather show a pattern of successful spawning during wet years followed by reduced spawning during dry years. USFWS (2010) found no evidence to show that the frequency of inundation events on floodplains will decrease to the point that these events will not be sufficient to maintain robust population levels. <br/><br/>Although global warming will change hydrography in the Delta, predictions do not foresee an imminent reduction in flooding of the Yolo Bypass (USFWS 2010). Splittail have continually adapted to changes in the ecosystem including salinity variation, and USFWS (2010) found no evidence to show that this will not continue to be the case. The Yolo and Sutter bypasses and the Cosumnes River floodplain serve as refuges for the species, and there is no evidence that these areas will not continue to do so in the future. These floodplains are currently being expanded through public and private partnerships.","This species is represented by more than 10 distinct spawning areas (see USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>Abundance is strongly tied to outflows, presumably due to reliance on submerged vegetation for spawning. Large outflows in March-April result in high reproductive success and population increases (Moyle 2002). No pre-water-development population estimates exist, and current abundance also is unknown (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>Geographic distribution has not decreased detectably over the last several decades (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain (USFWS 2010). Splittail populations fluctuate annually, depending on spawning success, which is positively correlated with freshwater outflow and the availability of shallow water habitat with submerged vegetation (see USFWS 2010). Abundance declined greatly during the severe drought of 1987–1993; populations recovered dramatically under favourable conditions in 1995 and 1998 (Moyle 2002).",Stable,"This species is native to rivers, sloughs, and lakes in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, California (Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>Distribution in the Sacramento River over the past 30 years has consistently ranged at least 232 to 296 river-kilometres (rkm)  upstream of the estuary. The consistent finding of Splittail more than 200 rkm upstream of the estuary may reflect a population persisting there or the long distance that Splittail migrate during dry years. Juveniles have been recorded at the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District Intake at rkm 331 in the Sacramento River year-round from 1994–2001. It is unknown why these individuals do not migrate downstream after spawning as do the majority of Splittail. Splittail have been documented in the Toulumne River to rkm 27.4 and in the Merced River to rkm 20.9 (13 mi). Splittail have been recorded in recent times from within Salt Slough. A 1998 California Department of Fish and Game gillnet survey of the tidal reaches of the Lower Walnut Creek found Splittail to be the most abundant fish in the creek. Splittail are found in the Napa Marsh during years with high freshwater flow but are rare during years of low freshwater outflow. Splittail have been observed in a number of tributaries of major rivers such as the Sacramento and San Joaquin and are likely distributed much more widely in small creeks and marshes throughout the lower portions of the estuary than known collections indicate. Suisun Marsh and Bay contain the largest areal extent of shallow water habitat available to the splittail and likely have the greatest concentrations of the species. Spawning habitat includes the natural and newly restored floodplains of the Cosumnes River, managed floodplains such as the Yolo and Sutter bypasses, and disjunct segments of floodplain adjacent to the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and tributaries. These areas approximate the large, open, shallow-water areas which once existed throughout the Delta. The largest portion of splittail spawning habitat occurs in the Yolo Bypass and higher Splittail young-of-the-year abundances are strongly correlated with the flooding of the Yolo Bypass. The best spawning conditions for Splittail occur in the bypass when water remains in the bypass until fish have completed spawning (at least 30 days), and larvae are able to swim out on their own during the draining process. In years where the Yolo and Sutter bypasses are not inundated for at least 30 days, Splittail spawning is confined primarily to the natural and newly restored  floodplains of the Cosumnes River and the margins of rivers and other floodplain features that are inundated at lower river stages. The Cosumnes River is unique in that it is the only major river flowing into the Delta that does not host a major dam. There are indications, based on presence of larvae and juveniles, that spawning in the Sacramento River occurs relatively far upstream at Colusa. Splittail also utilize the San Joaquin River for spawning in wet years when river flow exceeds the capacity for storage and flooding occurs. The Tuolumne, Cosumnes, Feather, American, Napa, and Petaluma rivers, and numerous other smaller waters, also support Splittail spawning activity. In summary, the geographic distribution of the splittail has not decreased detectably over the last several decades.

Historically, native Gulf populations of striped bass have never been abundant. &#160;Due to ecological constraints and anthropogenic alterations, the native Gulf population has recently been restricted to the southern extent of its historical range and is predicted to remain small despite large-scale stocking throughout the Gulf. &#160;The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System (ACF) is the only location where natural reproduction of native Gulf striped bass population has occurred since the 1970s. &#160;There are several merisitic, morphometric, and behavioral differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin populations of striped bass. &#160;Adult individuals of both populations are known to inhabit cool-water, oxygenated thermal refuges when&#160;water temperatures approach or exceed 25°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth (thermal refuges) has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months.<br/><br/>The last commercial landings of striped bass in the Gulf of Mexico were recorded in the 1960s; commercial fisheries for striped bass no longer exist in the Gulf. &#160;However, recreational fisheries still prevail throughout the Gulf. &#160;Recreational striped bass fisheries are most popular in Florida and Alabama, but limited in Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. &#160;In addition to fisheries pressure, the Gulf native striped bass population also faces several other threats. &#160;Existing ecological restraints of the area in addition to anthropogenic factors like segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. &#160;Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has also likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protected from predation for young fish.<br/><br/>The restoration of Gulf native striped bass population is a major focus of several state and federal agencies and organizations, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission,&#160;ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee, etc., all of which have collaborated through workshops to develop management plans to maintain this population throughout the Gulf. &#160;In addition to restoring and maintaining the native striped bass population in the Gulf, there are major initiatives to establish and maintain recreational striped bass fisheries and broodfish sources throughout most of the region. &#160;Most restoration plans encourage large-scale stocking of Gulf native and Atlantic-origin striped bass fry and fingerlings. &#160;However, many stocking efforts have failed or only managed to maintain current low numbers of striped bass in the Gulf (populations are not self-sustainable). &#160;Studies have shown that stocking efforts throughout the Gulf will continue to be limited if habitat restoration is not implemented in addition to large scale stocking because reproduction and recruitment of Gulf native striped bass is limited by lack of suitable habitat. &#160;The success of habitat restoration combined with stocking has yet to be determined. &#160;Management plans continue to be revised and studies continue to be conducted to determine the best way to restore the Gulf native striped bass population. &#160;There are also several harvest regulations on the size and amount of striped bass that can be caught in the Gulf of Mexico. &#160;Therefore, the Gulf native population of&#160;<em>Morone saxatilis </em>is listed as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","This is a marine and estuarine coastal species that moves far upstream in channels of medium to large rivers during spawning migrations.

The species has been widely introduced in lakes and impoundments with some populations&#160;landlocked.&#160;Ideal temperatures for&#160;<em>M. saxatilis&#160;</em>range from 18.3 to 21.1 °C. Evidence suggests a lower temperature limit of 9.0&#160;°C (Nelson <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;In colder months, it tends to seek the warmest water available at depths greater than 1.5 meters.<br/><br/>This species is anadromous, seasonally migratory and has been successfully introduced in many areas.&#160;It&#160;is a voracious predator that feeds primarily on fishes and invertebrates. It is normally gonochoristic, with a rare incidence of hermaphroditic individuals. Males reach maturity at about two years of age and 17 cm total length and females at four to six years and 45-55 cm. The maximum age&#160;has been estimated to about 30 years. Maximum total length is 200 cm (Page and Burr 1991); maximum published weight is 57.0 kg (Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1983).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass use rivers, tidally influenced fresh waters, and estuaries for spawning and nursery areas. This species is a polyandrous broadcast spawner. It spawns once a year, from April to mid-June, or once temperatures warm to about 18 °C. Females are estimated to release between 500,000 and 3 million eggs during a single spawning event, but &lt; 1% of embryos survive for more than a couple of months after hatching (Diodati 2007, Sanders 2010).&#160;Juveniles&#160;occupy inshore marine waters and adults ascend rivers to spawn. Preferred spawning areas often are shallow (1-20 feet, 0.3-6.1 meters) and turbid and range from the tidal zone to a few hundred kilometers upstream (usually within 38 miles or 60 km of coast). Spawners often seek areas with strong turbulent flow and substrates of rock and/or fine gravel. Eggs are semibuoyant, drift and sink slowly; in riverine populations, current of about 30 cm/sec reportedly is required to keep eggs afloat and prevent death due to settling on bottom (though this may vary with differences in egg buoyancy in different regions). Juveniles apparently prefer clean sandy bottom but have been found over gravel, rock, and (rarely) soft mud; may or may not move to areas of higher salinity in first summer/fall (varies with locality).<br/><br/>See Hill e<em>t al</em>. (1989) and Crance (1984) for habitat suitability index model and details on various environmental requirements and tolerances (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, toxicants).<br/><br/><strong>Native Gulf Population:<br/></strong>Gulf striped bass populations are most likely riverine and endemic to individual rivers due to lack of documentation of occurrence in open waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and there is very little evidence of interchange between river systems; migratory behavior appears to be reduced in Gulf native striped bass populations (Rulifson and Laney 1999). Additionally, tagging returns for stocked Gulf-strain striped bass indicate that they do not often travel outside the system in which they were released, and they they exhibit limited movement between release site and recapture locations (Frugé <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>A comparison of Atlantic-origin versus Gulf striped bass that were co-stocked into the same habitat over a 5-year period, showed no consistent differences in relative survival or growth through age 4 (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Gulf-native striped bass likely have a higher thermal tolerance than Atlantic-origin striped bass, with an upper thermal maximum around 30°C&#160;(Dieterich and Fulford 2012). &#160;&#160;<br/>There are several documented meristic differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin striped bass populations. &#160;It has also been reported that Gulf native striped bass eggs are less buoyant than Atlantic striped bass eggs from the Santee-Cooper system in South Carolina, and St. Johns River in Florida. &#160;In addition, Gulf native larvae tend to be slightly larger at hatching, have earlier yolk sac absorption, and begin feeding sooner than Atlantic-origin larvae. &#160;Hollowell (1980) reported that Gulf native striped bass have darker stripes than the Atlantic population, and that interrupted stripes occur less frequently than in the Atlantic race. Gulf native striped bass <em>may</em> also exhibit faster growth rates, and earlier maturation. &#160;Spawning period for Gulf native striped bass occurs from February to May, with a peak during early April to mid-May. &#160;Crateau (not determined) found that Gulf native striped bass females produce an average of approximately 45,000 eggs/kg body weight and exhibited at least 90% ova maturation in a single spawning season (Fruge<em> et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass adults are known to occupy cool, oxygenated thermal refuges in during the summer, from April through November (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Adults seek thermal refuge when water temperatures approach or exceed 25°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;If these refuges are not available during the typical periods of high growth, individuals may not reach sexual maturity.&#160;Dieterich and Fulford (2012) concluded that both of their model predictions combined with limited field observations of fish movement suggest that the period of maximum growth potential for Gulf-strain striped bass is October-April, which may limit young-of-the-year survival during their first summer and may greatly reduce the period of adult growth prior to the spawning season; studies indicate that summer months are the most critical time period for the overall health and long-term survival of striped bass.<br/>Between 1993 and 2009, 94 female and 125 male striped bass broodfish from the ACF were aged. Females ranged from age 2 to 13 and males ranged from age 2 to 7 (Long<em> et al.</em> 2012).<p></p>","<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><em><br/></em><em>Morone saxatilis&#160;</em>populations native to the Gulf of Mexico are limited due to ecological restraints, mainly high temperatures and low DO levels. &#160;These restraints are exacerbated by anthropogenic alterations to their riverine environment, including segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction which blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. The Gulf striped bass populations are also characterized by low levels of natural reproduction. Despite stocking large numbers of fish from Atlantic-origin populations, Gulf native populations are likely to remain small and may decrease due continuing fishing pressure and habitat degradation (Dieterich and Fulford 2012, Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protection from predation for young fish (Rulifson and Laney 1999,&#160;Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006). Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><br/>The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system was modeled under changing climate conditions simulating future climates and future demand for water withdrawal for human consumption. Specific anticipated changes include lower minimum flows and decreased flow variability. These changes could decrease connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent (Gibson <em>et a</em>l. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Introgression<br/></strong>Historically unique microsatelite alleles in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system in Geogia and Florida were reduced in frequency by introgression of non-native alleles due to stocking (Wirgin <em>et al</em>. 2005). Possible results include altered genetic characteristics of the native stock which can cause a change in genetic differences among populations (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 2009), a change in genetic composition (Susnik <em>et al</em>. 2004), and breakdown of genetic adaptations (McGinnity <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>Declines in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (where introduced) is attributed primarily to toxic substances and to entertainment of young in water diversion structures (Hassler 1988). Habitat destruction affected populations in Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Albemarle Sound, resulting in drastic declines in mid-20th century (Hill<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1989). Excess harvest contributed the decline along the U.S. east coast in the late 1970s and early 1980s; hatchery production and restrictions on the harvest resulted in population increases in the Chesapeake Bay region by the early 1990s (Diamond 1990).","<strong>Gulf of Mexico [[<span style="""">[supplementary document: excel sheet]]]</span></strong><p>Although striped bass is an anadromous species, populations at the northern and southern extremes of the range are generally potamodromous, migrating within freshwater systems and thus being riverine or estuarine in nature. &#160;It is likely that striped bass populations within tributaries of the Gulf of Mexico were endemic to individual rivers (Barkuloo 1967, McIlwain 1980). </p>  <p>Within the Gulf, the historical range of <em>M. saxatilis</em> from the Suwannee River (Florida), westward to the rivers of the Lake Pontchartrain basin in Louisiana.

In the 1980s interest in the conservation and restoration of the native Gulf striped bass led to stocking of only putative Gulf striped bass. </p>  <p>The restoration program is supported by genetic studies which show that a high percentage of ACF fish are genetically distinct from Atlantic populations (Wirgin 1990, 1991 1993, 1997), (Wirgin and Maceda 1991). The ACF population is now considered a different “race” from those in Atlantic rivers (Frugé&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2006), and any striped bass originating from the ACF system is considered a Gulf striped bass (Long et al. 2012). The ACF population is the only population of Gulf striped bass which supports continued natural reproduction (Wirgin<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Although genetically distinct from the Atlantic population, significant introgression of Atlantic nuclear DNA has occurred in the ACF population (Wirgin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</span></p><p><strong>Abundance<br/> </strong>Apalachicola river:<strong> </strong>CPUE for all broodfish trended upward from 1990 (2.3 fish/h) until 1998 (11.90 fish/h), reached its high in 2003, and reached its low in 2007.

It has been introduced widely in inland areas of the United States and on the Pacific coast, where it has spread north to British Columbia and south to northern Baja California.

It is marketed fresh or filleted and frozen (Heemstra 2002). Recreational landings&#160;make up about 75-80% of the coastal landings. In 2005, almost 60% of all striped bass sold in the United States were grown in aquaculture.&#160;Aquaculture for hybrid <em>M. saxatilis</em> (<em>Morone chrysops</em> x <em>Morone saxatilis</em>) began in 1986, and production peaked in the early 2000s (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012).&#160;<em> </em><br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no commercial striped bass fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico; the last commercial landings occurred in the 1960s. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries are still popular throughout their range in the Gulf (Frugé&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). &#160;<br/><br/>Creel census surveys were conducted in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama to determine striped bass total catch, harvest effort (hours), and angler success (striped bass catch or harvest per hour). &#160;In the Upper Apalachicola River, an average of 166 striped bass anglers (ranged from 24 to 416) were interviewed between 1982 and 2009. &#160;Directed angling effort was estimated to range from 1,098 (SE = 318) to 9, 485 (SE = 2,936) hours with an average of 3,696 hours. &#160;Annual harvest estimates during early stocking years (1980 to 1992) ranged from 152 (SE = 130) to 1,505 (SE = 474). &#160;Released striped bass were not documented in the survey data prior to 1992; it was assumed that under prevailing harvest regulations, all caught fish were harvested. &#160;Surveys conducted after harvest regulations were changed (1994 to 2009) to reduce the bag implementation and minimum size, estimated that striped bass total catch ranged from 311 (SE = 156) to 1,457 (SE=346) with and average of 688 fish. &#160;Harvest estimates ranged from 134 (SE = 49) to 796 (SE = 214), and averaged 379 fish (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Few anglers targeted or harvested striped bass in the Lower Apalachicola River/Intracoastal Waterway. &#160;Creel survey were conducted in this area during spring 1990-2004 and fall 1990-1999. &#160;The number of anglers interviewed in this area ranged from 250 to 550 and 225 to 502, respectively. &#160;Total catch estimates ranged from 2 (SE = 2) to 1,458 (SE = 990) in the spring, and 11 (SE = 12) to 1,521 (SE = 749) in the fall. &#160;In this area, striped bass were typically caught as bycatch, and most anglers reported releasing their catch because the fish were shorter than the 457-mm-TL minimum size limit. &#160;From the spring surveys, it was estimated that only 1,484 (15%) of the 9,831 striped bass total catch estimate was harvested (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Creel surveys from the striped bass fishery in the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers were conducted from 1995 through 1998. &#160;Within the 26-week period, total number of angler trips at the Albany Dam tailrace (Flint River) ranged from 1,741 to 5,553 with an anverage of 3,855 trips. &#160;Estimated time of direct fishing effort on striped bass averaged 801 hours, and ranged from 442 to 1,056 hours. Expanded harvest estimates ranged from 15 to 37 fish, with an average of 28 fish. &#160;The total number of angler trips taken at the GALD on the Chattahoochee River averaged 6,134 trips, and ranged from 4,758 to 7,437 trips. &#160;Hours directed fishing effort ranged from 0 to 466 hours (1192 hours on average). &#160;Expanded harvest estimates for striped bass ranged from 0 to 70, and averaged 30 fish. &#160;All of these surveys were conducted during open season for the harvest of <em>Morone saxatilis</em> (1 November-31 May). &#160;Harvest regulations for striped bass in the ACF during the time of survey were 15 fish in combination, including striped bass, hybrid striped bass, and white bass, only two of which could be over 559 mm TL (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><br/>Currently, the Jim Woodruff L&amp;D tail race is the primary location for anglers targeting striped bass in Florida. &#160;This recreational fishery has been described as an ""artisanal"" fishery, and angling effort there appears to have remained near the levels (possibly above) estimated at the time restoration efforts began. &#160;From 1980 to 2003, angler effort in this tailrace ranged from 629 hours in 1981 to 9,485 hours in 1991 (Fruge <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational striped bass fisheries in the Tallapoosa, Coosa, Alabama, Tombigbee, and Mobile rivers were discontinued in 1962 when the population declined. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries in reservoirs along the Black Warrior and Tombigbee rivers, Lewis Smith Lake, Lake Martin, Jones Bluff Lake, and some reservoirs along the Coosa River have continued their stocking efforts. &#160;Striped bass are also regularly taken from the Mobile River and bay systems, and the Perdido and Conecuh rivers (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Throughout Mississippi, striped bass has been mostly recorded as bycatch by anglers (not targeted). &#160;It has been indicated that a small amount of anglers target striped bass in the Pascagoula River. &#160;Several records since 1981 reported no recreational landings, however there was a peak in 1986 with 14,154 fish caught (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational fishing for striped bass in Louisiana is very limited. &#160;Fishermen catch striped bass incidentally along the coast, and some charter boats/guides target this species at certain times of the year. &#160;There is a small recreational striped bass fishery in the Lake Pontchartrain. &#160;Reported recreational landings have been noted to fluctuate widely and are probably not accurate (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Based on recent TPWD creel data, no substantial striped bass fishery exists anywhere along the Texas coast. &#160;However, a few anglers in the Galveston and Sabine Lakes target this species. &#160; There is a directed striped bass fishery in Galveston Bay at the outfall in Trinity Bay and is popular during March (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System:</strong><br/>Since the extirpation of the Gulf native&#160;population from most river drainages in the Gulf of Mexico in the mid-1960s, restoration of these populations has been a major focus of fisheries managers in the region. &#160;Atlantic-origin striped bass began to be stocked into many Gulf rivers and reservoirs throughout the 1960s, and continues to the present in some tributaries. &#160;Stocking programs for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were initiated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) for Lake Seminole in 1965, and Lake Blackshear (Flint River, Georgia) in 1967. &#160;The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (currently the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or FFWC) began releasing fingerlings of Atlantic origin into the Apalachicola River in 1976. &#160;Approximately 1.8 million Atlantic fry (&lt;15 mm) and 125,000 fingerlings or adults (25-750 mm TL) were stocked into the ACF from 1965 to 1976. &#160;Hybrid striped bass were also introduced into ACF reservoirs during the 1970s&#160;(Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>Starting in the 1980s, ACF fisheries managers began focusing on the conservation and restoration of the native striped bass population. Genetic description and cataloging was a major component of this effort. &#160;The first annual <em>Morone </em>workshop was in 1982, where biologists and fisheries managers from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) met to discuss management of native and hybrid striped bass in the ACF. &#160;Representatives of conservation agencies in each state and the regional director of the FWS entered into a cooperative agreement of Gulf striped bass restoration for the ACF in 1987. &#160;This agreement emphasized the restoration of a self-sustaining population of Gulf striped bass to the maximum extent possible. &#160;The ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee was also formed under this agreement. &#160;Representatives from Mississippi, Louisiana, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, New York University School of Medicine, Gulf Coast Research Lab (southern Mississippi), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became participants of the workshop series, and as of 2011 the ACF <em>Morone </em>workshop had met for 29 consecutive years (Long<em> et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The first striped bass management plan for the ACF was finalized in 1996 (revised in 2004) with a general goal of enhancing the native Gulf striped bass population within the river system. &#160;Project objectives included:<ul><li>determining hatchery production requirements and optimum stocking rates and sizes</li><li>monitoring broodfish collections and stocking success</li><li>monitoring the sport fishery</li><li>identifying, enhancing, or protecting thermal refuge habitat</li><li>establishing broodfish repositories outside of the ACF</li><li>and participating in public outreach</li></ul>The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's (GSMFC) Anadromous Fish Subcommittee created the ""Striped Bass Fishery Management Plan"" for the Gulf of Mexico (this plan was revised in 2006) (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;The goals of this comprehensive plan were to:<ul><li>establish and maintain a self-sustaining Gulf race population and fishery in the Pearl River (Louisiana and Mississippi), Pascagoula River (Mississippi), Escambia/Conecuh River (Alabama and Florida), Choctawhatchee Riverr (Alabama and Florida), and ACF river system (Alabama, Florida, and Georgia)</li><li>maintain mixed-race fisheries in the Mobile-Alabama-Tombigbee (MAT) river system</li><li>maintain a striped bass recreational fishery in the lower Mississippi River</li><li>maintain Gulf race put-and-grow fisheries in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte rivers (Louisiana), Perdido River (Alabama and Florida), Blackwater and Yellow rivers (Florida), and the Ochlockonee River (Florida and Georgia)</li><li>maintain striped bass put-grow-take fisheries in the Wolf, Jourdan, Biloxi, and Tchoutacabouffa river and Old Fort Bayou (Mississippi)</li></ul>Benefits from stocking large numbers of Atlantic-origin striped bass have not been consistently sustained through time and have not resulted in the ability of the population to self-sustain at a desired level that is significantly larger than previously observed from natural reproduction alone. &#160;Due to ecological restraints and anthropogenic alterations to the riverine environment, feasible opportunities for restoration of Gulf native striped bass populations are limited in a degraded habitat. &#160;In addition, stocking of large numbers of hatchery fish has not prevented the loss of the pure ""Gulf race"" striped bass population. &#160;The physical renovation of several thermal refuges in the Apalachicola and Flint rivers met the objectives (habitat restoration or enhancement) of the ACF plan. &#160;However, due to the dynamic nature of the ACF river system, these renovation efforts were small and short-lived (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fisheries managers from Florida and Alabama have committed to stocking only Gulf striped bass into Gulf of Mexico tributaries within their historic range. &#160;Managers in Mississippi and Louisiana have also expressed a desire to stock only Gulf striped bass, but with the realization that they cannot sacrifice their established striped bass fisheries when Gulf fingerlings are not available for stocking. &#160;Therefore, fish managers in Mississippi are developing a broodfish repository in Ross Barnett Reservoir (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><br/>There is also a current conservation plan in Mississippi to restore naturally-reproducing, Gulf native populations in the Pearl and Pascagoula River systems through a stock enhancement program; the program began in 1967 and remains active today. &#160;However, due to the lack of studies on factors that limit growth and survival of released striped bass in Mississippi waters, seasonal habitat availability in the habitat is relatively unknown. &#160;As in the ACF, probability for population restoration is low in the coastal waters of Mississippi without improvement of the current degraded habitat (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><br/>As of 2002, striped bass had been stocked into at least 68 reservoirs on 11 Texas river systems since the 1960s. &#160;This has been described as one of the largest freshwater striped bass stocking programs in the nation, despite the discontinuation of stocking in some reservoirs. &#160;Most stocking sources were from Atlantic-origin fisheries, but a small number of Gulf native striped bass have also been stocked into Texas waters. &#160;Several successful and popular fisheries have been established in stocked lakes, including Toledo Bend Reservoir (shared with Louisiana). &#160;Natural reproduction by striped bass has been documented in the Brazos River and Trinity River in Texas but these populations are not known to be self-sustaining, and recruitment of naturally spawned striped bass into the adult population has not yet been determined. &#160;Though the river-stocking program in Texas produced successful fisheries, the bay-stocking program did not. &#160;Only 64 striped bass were caught from 1983 to 2003 by fishery-independent sampling. &#160;Most striped bass catches from fisheries were a recorded as bycatch (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><br/>Stocking in Louisiana started in the 1960s when fry were introduced in Toledo Band Reservoir and D'Arbonne Reservoir, and expanded in 1972 to inlcude stocking of several coastal rivers and estuarine areas in tan attempt to establish anadromous/coastal populations. &#160; As relatively small number of Gulf native striped bass has been stocked into two lakes in recent years, but the remainder of stocking in Louisiana was sourced from the Atlantic-origin population. &#160;There was an unsuccessful effort to establish Gulf native brood stock sources in Louisiana. &#160;In the Toledo Bend Reservoir, a put-grow-and-take striped bass fishery has been established, but no significant riverine or coastal fisheries have developed in Louisiana (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:</strong><br/>The ADCNR/WFF striped bass stocking program in Alabama has been very important to the success of the fisheries in many of the reservoirs and tailwater areas of the MAT. &#160;It is likely that a limited striped bass fishery developed in coastal Alabama in 1992, but the fish produced were not preferred by anglers. &#160;The coastal stocking program in Alabama's Mobile River Delta (MRD) was discontinued in 1995, and that fishery has likely declined since that time. &#160;Substantial natural reproduction and recruitment into downstream populations has been documented in the upper Coosa River, which is assumed to mostly involve Atlantic-origin striped bass. &#160;Natural striped bass spawning also occurs in lower portions of the MAT, but it has not been determined if this involves Atlantic or Gulf race fish and whether it has resulted in recruitment. &#160;Natural reproduction alone (without stocking) has not yet been assessed to determine if it can sustain populations/fisheries in the MAT. &#160;Most striped bass populations throughout the MAT are a combination of Atlantic- and Gulf-origin fish except for portions of the Black Warrior River (upstream of Warrior Dam), which may primarily be populated by Gulf native striped bass (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Striped bass stocking began in 1961 when 307-461 mm sub-adults from the Chesapeake Bay were released into Lake Talquin. &#160;In the early 1970s, striped bass were introduced into small lakes and reservoirs of the Florida Peninsula in order to control shad populations and provided a supplemental fishery. &#160;Shad populations were successfully controlled, but fishery establishment failed. &#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass in the Escambia/Conecuh system is uncertain due to lack of data. &#160;Annual stocking in the Blackwater and Yellow rivers is likely maintaining its population. &#160;The striped bass population in the Choctawhatchee River is likely being maintained at a low level by recent stocking efforts. &#160;Since 1996, only Gulf native striped bass fingerlings have been stocked into Lake Talquin in an effort to establish a Gulf native broodstock source. &#160;There is a limited striped bass population and fishery in the Ochlockonee River that is likely supported by stock enhancement. &#160;There is no data available for the striped bass population in the Suwanee River and no substantial amount of striped bass have been stocked into the system; there is doubt whether this system has ever supported a reproducing population of striped bass. &#160; &#160;<br/>The status of the striped bass population in the smaller gulf Coast rivers of Florida is unknown due to lack of data. &#160;However, it was documented that approximately 1,000 Gulf native striped bass fingerlings were stocked adjacent to the St. Mark's River (St. Mark's National Wildlife Refuge impoundments) in 1984. &#160;There are also occasional reported recreational catches from the St. Mark's River (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>Morone saxatilis</em> (Gulf native population)<em>&#160;</em>is likely to be managed by many other government agencies and programs.

It is not found in floodplains, swamps or marshes in New Jersey (Nyman <em>et al.</em> 1988). In central Pennsylvania, embryonic mortality was high in ponds below pH 4.5, though this was affected by the availability of other larval amphibians as prey (Sadinski and Dunson 1992).&#160;Courtship and egg deposition, which occurs in early spring, may occur under the ice of vernal pools.

Furthermore, at some sites where both&#160;<em>A. jeffersonianum&#160;</em>and unisexuals did still exist in 2003-04, there was a notable reduction in the number of egg masses compared to numbers found in the earlier surveys (COSEWIC 2010).",Stable,"This species' range was mapped by Conant and Collins (1991) as encompassing an area in the USA from southeastern New York through Pennsylvania and eastern and southern Ohio to southern Indiana, and southward to south-central Kentucky and northern Virginia, with an extensive area of hybridisation with <em>A. </em><em>laterale</em> northward of this range to eastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and eastward to Nova Scotia.

Data presented by Bogart and Klemens (1997) indicate that the few populations in New England and New York represented by only the <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> genome had sample sizes of only 1-3 individuals, so these actually might have been hybrid populations. Phillips (1991) extended the range of <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> into east central Illinois, based on one juvenile raised from a larva, but since only one specimen was examined (and he did not indicate what identification criteria were used), it is unclear whether or not the population represents pure <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> or a hybrid population.

Negative impacts of intensive timber harvesting extend at least 25-35 m into uncut forest (deMaynadier and Hunter 1998). Many sub-populations are becoming increasingly isolated as deforestation and loss of vernal pools reduce gene flow among demes (Petranka 1998). This might result in inbreeding depression and reduce the probability of re-establishment of extirpated sub-populations. Local sub-populations might be heavily impacted by excessive mortality of adults caused by vehicles on roads near breeding sites. Roads negatively impact salamander abundance in roadside habitat and might serve as partial barriers to movement (deMaynadier and Hunter 2000). Embryo mortality generally decreases as pH deceases below 6.0, though in some areas successful reproduction has occurred at a relatively low pH (Cook 1983, Blem and Blem 1989). In central Pennsylvania, low pH was associated with deleterious sub lethal effects on larvae (Sadinski and Dunson 1992). High concentrations of various chemical elements, unfavourable temperatures, or low oxygen content might result in reproductive failure; see Blem and Blem (1991) and Albers and Prouty (1987). De-icing salts that contaminate roadside vernal pools result in reduced embryonic survival (Turtle 2000).","Total adult population size is unknown but is very large, surely greater than 100,000 and probably exceeds 1,000,000.

Although sub-species level conservation management is warranted for many subpopulations, <em>Gasterosteus aculeatus </em>is globally listed as Least Concern.","This species is typically found in quiet weedy pools and backwaters. It is also found in the marginal vegetation of streams, over sand and mud bottom substrates. Marine populations are pelagic, and usually found inshore along the coast, in estuaries and coastal lagoons. In some lakes, two morphologically and ecologically distinct forms may occur, differing in habitat and morphology (one littoral, the other mainly limnetic) (Taylor 1999).&#160;<br/>The species can be anadromous, but there are numerous resident populations in brackish or pure freshwater. Anadromous populations forage at sea until two years old, then move to lower parts of rivers in March-April to reproduce (van Mullem and van der Vlugt 1964). Freshwater populations usually spawn for the first time at one year. In spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes. They defend territories, in which in April-June they construct a nest on the bottom, in relatively shallow areas, very rarely attached to plants. They make a depression up to 14 × 10 cm to which they bring plant materials (especially filamentous algae), which are glued together with kidney secretions.&#160;Eggs are deposited in freshwater in a nest of plant material made by the male on the bottom in shallow water (Craig-Bennett 1931, Sargent and Gebler 1980). The female will typically lay a few hundred eggs and may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days (Morrow 1980).<br/>Several females are individually led to the nest to spawn, then chased away. Males guard and fan eggs to provide them with oxygenated water. &#160;Eggs hatch in 7-8 days and juveniles are guarded for a few days after which the male abandons the nest. Anadromous individuals usually die of exhaustion after spawning, while freshwater individuals are able to complete several cycles within one year or sometimes over several years. Juveniles move to sea (anadromous populations) or to deeper, larger water bodies (freshwater populations) in July-August where they form large feeding schools (Symons 1971).&#160;<br/>They feed on small aquatic invertebrates, especially insects and crustaceans (Kuiter 2000).","No major widespread threats known.

Eggs probably are scattered over silt-bottomed backwaters.","Threats are related to water management and flow modifications. Diversion of water has resulted in changes in flow regime in both mainstem rivers and tributary streams. Construction of passage barriers, such as diversion dams and reservoirs, have both degraded and fragmented habitat. Introduced non-native species have become both predators and competitors with the Plains minnow. For example, expansion in abundance and range of Blackstripe Topminnow, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Creek Chub was associated with a decline of Plains Minnow and other native fish populations in the Missouri River (Winston 2002). Other threats include hybridization, altered flow regimes, disturbance of riparian zones, and landscape scale changes that reduce the natural function of the stream ecosystem. Source: Rees <em>et al</em>. (2005).<br/><br/>The elimination of highly variable water levels, unstable streambeds, and fluctuating water temperatures are among the reasons for declines (Cross et al. 1985). The Northern Prairie Research Center (1995) indicated that the greatest threats are non-point source pollution and mainstem impoundments impacting natural flow regimes and other threats across the range include dewatering of rivers from irrigation and degradation of riparian areas.<br/><br/>Elimination of flood events has removed the historical cues for spawning and reduced the quality and quantity of available spawning habitat (Wilde and Ostrand 1999). Degradation of braided channel systems due to highly modified flow regimes (e.g., reduction of peak flows, flow stability, reduced turbidity) has contributed to the decline in Plains Minnow populations in some drainages, such as the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado (Cross and Moss 1987).<br/><br/>Declines in the Canadian River drainage (Oklahoma and Texas) were probably due to the reduced occurrence of large floods (Bonner and Wilde 2000). The impoundment of the Double Mountain Fork in the Brazos River may have resulted in the extirpation of the Plains Minnow from reaches above the dam (Wilde and Ostrand 1999).<br/><br/>Both of the two known locations in Canada are small streams that are subject to drought; further threats to water supply from additional irrigation dams and excessive drought would increase risks to this species (COSEWIC 2015).<br/><br/>Damming of the North Fork of the Red River in southwestern Oklahoma may have eliminated populations above the dam (Winston et al. 1991). Threats in New Mexico include impoundments and dewatering; the species is possibly eliminated above Ute Reservoir on the Canadian River (Bob Larson pers. comm. 1998).<br/><br/>According to Eberle (1995), declines in Kansas might be tied to changes in flow regimes of rivers following dam construction and dewatering. Declines in the Arkansas River drainage have been attributed to the effects of impoundments, land use, diversion of surface flow for irrigation, and reduction of water table levels in response to mining of groundwater for irrigation (Cross and Moss 1987).<br/><br/>The degree of threat is not known across most of the range, but has been estimated by some heritage programs to range from very threatened to not very threatened; very threatened in Kansas (Bill Busby pers. comm. 1998), not very threatened in North Dakota (Greg Power pers. comm. 1998), and not very threatened to unthreatened in Kentucky (Ron Cicerello pers. comm. 1998).","This species is represented by a large number of occurrences (subpopulations). In general, the number of occurrences appears to be low in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, New Mexico, and in other states on the periphery of the range, but relatively large numbers of occurrences still exist in Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wyoming, North Dakota, and other northern portions of the range.<br/><br/>This is a small fish that inhabits large rivers and is difficult to survey (Ron Cicerello and Peggy Shute pers. comm. 1998), so available data may not accurately reflect current distribution and abundance.<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but very large.  Page and Burr (2011) regarded this as ""one of the most characteristic and common (sometimes abundant) fishes of Great Plains.""<br/><br/>This species is considered to be abundant in the upper Missouri River watershed, whereas it is less numerous in areas farther south. During a 1993 survey, this was one of the most commonly collected species in the Little Missouri River, North Dakota (Kelsch 1994). During 1984-1988, Bazata <em>et al</em>. (1991) collected 208 individuals from 350 stream sites across Nebraska (excluding the Missouri River). This species is uncommon in the lower Mississippi River (Northern Prairie Research Centre 1998).<br/><br/>Over the long term, this species has undergone a large decline in distribution and abundance (Rees <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Baxter and Simon (1970) stated that plains minnows were virtually eliminated from the North Platte River, Wyoming, but indicated that the species is not really in trouble statewide. However, based on a comparison of 1960 data and sampling data from the 1990s, the species may be declining in Wyoming (Mary Neighbours pers. comm. 1998).<br/><br/>According to Hesse (1994), Plains/Western Silvery Minnows were once considered abundant in Nebraska, but surveys over the past three decades indicate possible declines in some areas. During 1976-1978 Hesse (1994) collected 40 Plains/Silvery minnows from the lower Niobrara River while zero were collected in 1991. During Missouri River studies conducted from 1970-1993 the percent composition of seined Plains/Western Silvery Minnows in the channelized portion of the river was 27.1 in 1970 and zero in 1993; the percent composition of Plains/Western Silvery Minnows in the unchannelized Missouri River above and below Gavins Point Dam was less than one percent from 1983-1993 (Hesse 1994). Although declines have occurred in some areas of Nebraska, the species may be stable in the remainder of the state (Mike Fritz pers. comm. 1998).<br/><br/>This species has undergone dramatic declines in abundance throughout Missouri in recent decades; if declines continue it may soon be extirpated from the state (Pflieger 1997).<br/><br/>Historically, Plains Minnows were considered abundant in Kansas rivers (Cross 1967), but more recently have been reported to have decreased substantially in the Arkansas, Smoky Hill, and Republican river drainages (Cross <em>et al</em>., 1985, Eberle 1995, Eberle <em>et al</em>. 1997). Historically this species was the most common fish of the Arkansas River system, but its abundance and distribution have decreased substantially in the Arkansas River drainage in Kansas  (Cross and Moss 1987, Taylor and Miller 1990). It has declined to less than 1 percent of the overall fish population in the Arkansas River (Cross and Moss 1987). Plains Minnows were formerly common and widespread in the Kansas River drainage but have declined dramatically throughout that system (Wenke <em>et al</em>. 1993). The species may be extirpated from portions of the western Kansas River drainage, including the Republican, Solomon, Saline, and Smoky Hill rivers, and it is now rare in the lower portion of the Kansas River drainage (Cross and Moss 1987, Wenke <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/>This is ""one of Oklahoma's ubiquitous species"" but ""recent declines...in the large rivers of Oklahoma are the cause of some concern (W. J. Matthews pers. comm. 2003)"" (Miller and Robison 2004).

Plains Minnows are possibly extirpated from the Dry Cimarron River and the Canadian River above the Ute Reservoir; populations in in the Canadian River below Ute Reservoir are possibly stable (Bob Larson and David Propst pers. comm. 1998).

Its original habitat was probably marshes and flood plain pools along the lower Colorado River and springs throughout the Salton Sink (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980, Moyle 2002, Page and Burr 2011). This fish tolerates low oxygen levels, high temperatures, and high salinity. Males establish small territories prior to spawning, usually in water less than 1 meter deep (sometimes deeper). Eggs are laid on substrate of sand, mud, or perhaps preferentially on algal mat (Schoenherr 1988).<br/><br/>Most re-established populations are in human-constructed environments (USFWS 2010).","Populations are now drastically reduced due to marsh drainage, groundwater mining, deforestation, overgrazing, agricultural use of water, dam building, real estate development, encroachment by non-native vegetation such as <em>Tamarix </em>(Schoenherr 1988), pesticide blowover, and perhaps most importantly, introduction of exotic predators and competitors (especially <em>Tilapia zilli</em>, <em>Oreochromis </em>spp., and mosquitofish).<br/><br/>Threats identified at the time of listing and in the recovery plan continue unabated. New non-native aquatic species continue to establish within the Desert Pupfish's range, and previously existing nonnative species increase in numbers and distribution (Minckley and Marsh 2009). Human demands for water are unending, with the Salton Sea and Lower Colorado River suffering water level declines and the associated threats to the Desert Pupfish from water depletion, such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality still ongoing. Water availability to the Desert Pupfish will continue to interact with predicted trends for warmer, drier, and more extreme hydrological conditions associated with climate change (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>This species is relatively intolerant of competition and predation; it is easily displaced by introduced fishes.

Ortubay (1998) observed a narrow range of feeding temperatures, concluding that individuals cannot feed at waters of less than 17ºC. Maturity is reached at 37 mm TL in males and 38 mm TL in females. The breeding season occurs during late winter and early spring (August-October).

Other threats are the impact of cows, horses, sheep and goat livestock, that promote changes in environmental conditions given by water quality changes, change in meso-habitat structures, modification of riparian condition including bank erosion and vegetation removal and water pollution. In addition, sites where the fish was not recorded or it was recorded in low densities, were found to have exotic trees, whose roots reach the springs and stream shores, causing a change in the original habitat (Velasco <em>et al</em>. 2016). Other threats are related to water pumps, channelizations and dam development for water storage that could modify the geomorphic and hydrological conditions of the stream. Also, increasing temperature and decreasing snow in Patagonia as predicted by climate change for the current century (Core Writing Team <em>et al</em>. 2014) could promote a reduction in flow.<br/><span class=""ninguno""><span class=""ninguno""><span class=""normaltextrun""><span class=""ninguno""><span class=""normaltextrun""><span class=""normaltextrun""><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span></span></p>","<p>                   </p><p>                   </p><p>Although some sites still exist at the Valcheta Stream, where it is possible to find shoals of up to 300 individuals, they are isolated from other shoals distributed along the restricted range of this species. The lack of accurate density estimations precludes an estimate of the current population size. However, a decline in the distributional range of the species can be inferred when comparing previous and current surveys, suggesting a population decline. Moreover, observations made by Quiroga and Povedano (pers. obs.) confirm a change in the proportion of individuals of Naked Characin and <em>Cheirodon interruptus</em>, indicating that the Naked Characin is declining while <em>Cheirodon interruptus</em> is thriving. Given that the species has a very low dispersal ability, and the fact that it is restricted to only certain parts of the stream, its population is considered to be severely fragmented following IUCN definitions. The species is currently restricted to seven known subpopulations (five of them are very small, occupying an area of less than 0.5 km²). The flow of individuals between these subpopulations is very low or even absent, since the branches of the stream that could connect them are occupied by high densities of trout.<br/><span class=""ninguno""><span class=""ninguno""><span class=""ninguno""><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"This species is known only from the headwaters of Arroyo Valcheta in the Somuncurá Plateau, an isolated basaltic plateau in the Río Negro Province, Argentinean Patagonia. Given exhaustive and extensive surveys conducted between 1993-1997 (Ortubay 1998) and between 2013-2017 (Kacoliris <em>et al</em>. 2015, Quiroga, M.Sc. in prep), its distribution is considered as genuinely micro-endemic. This restricted range is in agreement with habitat preferences of this species. Since the headwaters of the Valcheta Stream originate from thermal springs, the water of the first 10 km approximately has high temperatures ranging, through the year, between 18 and 26ºC. The Naked Characin is adapted to live in this type of environment, which is uncommon in Patagonian streams. Past and current observed occurrence for this species shows a decline in its range to less than a half of its historical known distribution, with an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of less than 40 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of less than 10 km². This decline is in coincidence with the increasing expansion in range of the exotic salmonid, the Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>), towards the headwaters of the stream since its introduction at the beginning of the 20th century (Macchi and Vigliano 2014). Such behaviour could be related to a rapid local adaptation and heritability for higher temperatures in juveniles of this population of Rainbow Trout (Crichigno <em>et al</em>. 2015, Quiroga <em>et al</em>. 2017). The Naked Characin is considered to occur in one threat-defined location, based on the ubiquitous presence of introduced salmonids in the basin that predate on this endemic fish (Quiroga <em>et al</em>. 2017), and a recently introduced species of characid (<em>Cheirodon interruptus</em>) that is thriving in the stream and is assumed to be a strong competitor for food and space with the Naked Characin (Perez <em>et al</em>. 2015).<p>                   </p>",<p>Records exist of individuals caught for illegal trade of this species for collectors (Ortubay and Cussac 2000).&#160;</p>,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions in Place</strong><br/>The range of the species distribution is within the Somuncurá Provincial Reserve.

However, since 2013 the Wild Plateau Initiative has been working on in-situ efforts aimed at protecting this species and it has an agreement in place with the local protected area authorities (F. Kacoliris, S. Quiroga, pers. comm). A management plan for exotic fishes from the headwaters of the Valcheta Stream is currently being discussed and preliminary actions are planned to start at the end of 2017. In addition, a change in the legal framework is required to avoid new exotic species introductions and to support the removal of all exotic species.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Needed<br/></strong>Additional recommendations include adopting urgent and concrete conservation measures that encompass the regulated use of streams, removal of exotic fishes, and protection of headwaters in the plateau.

Adults are found in waters that range in temperature and salinity from 8 to 24°C, and 0 ppt to 75 ppt respectively. Juveniles are able to tolerate salinities from 0 ppt to 35 ppt (Bester 2004). It is capable of surviving temperatures ranging from 12-25°C&#160;(Harrison and Senou 1999).&#160;It<em>&#160;</em>is a benthopelagic, catadromous species that is usually found at a depth of zero to 10 m, but can be found as deep as 120 m (Moreira 1992, Harrison 1995, Riede 2004). It often enters estuaries and rivers and forms schools over sand or mud bottoms (Eschmeyer <em>et al. </em>1983, Thompson 1986, Allen 1991, Yamada <em>et al. </em>1995, Allen<em> et al.</em> 2002). Adults filter out organic detritus, microscopic algae, and small particulate materials by gulping sediment. It&#160;is mainly diurnal, feeding on zooplankton as larvae and detritus, micro-algae and benthic organisms as juvenile and adult fish (Blaber 1976, Tung 1981, Cardona 2000).&#160;Juveniles feed on zooplankton, larger individuals filter algae, detritus, sediment and small invertebrates.

Offspring are spawned offshore by schooling adults and fry eventually migrate inshore while feeding on zooplankton. Tag returns along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast indicate that&#160;<em>M. cephalus</em>&#160;do not make extensive migrations in this region, but instead remain in a relatively small area and return to their original bay system after spawning (Hill 2004).

December, moving in shoals from lagoons to the sea. They are targeted by fishers via gill net during these migrations&#160;because of the high value of the gonad (roe). It reaches age at first maturity at three years and&#160;an average size of 30 cm, and is exploited at this age in Laguna Madre.&#160;Over&#160;the past 12 years, catch in&#160;Laguna Madre&#160;has remained on average 3,500 tonnes.&#160;In Tamiahua Lagoon, catch has declined by&#160;70%&#160;since the 1960s and 70s. The maximum sustainable yield for  in Laguna Madre in the year 2000 was estimated at 3,017 tonnes. Over the years, catch has had a cyclic manner with ebbs and flows between 3,000 and approximately 5,000 tonnes, with declines in catch corresponding to the years when MSY was exceeded. Off Tamaulipas, both  and  are considered fully exploited. Off Veracruz, has experienced a 70% decline in catch since the year 2000 (SAGARPA 2012). Catch of mullets off&#160;Cuba&#160;have declined markedly due to overfishing of spawning aggregations and migrations (Claro 2009).&#160;There is no evidence of overfishing in the 2010 Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute report and there is 35% SPR target. This species was among the top ten most abundant species collected from the lower mouth of the Peace River in Florida. Specimens were collected using 21.3 m seines in from April 1997 to May 1999 and July 2007 to April 2010 (Stevens 2013). Mullet were among the ten dominant species collected from tidal streams throughout the coast of Texas (Tolan and Nelson 2013). It is also one of the most abundant species collected with bag seines in every bay system in Texas (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014, Texas Parks and Wildlife database). Its estimated area of occupancy (AOO) in the Gulf of Mexico is 155,503 km (calculated by clipping the distribution polygon to the zero to 20 m bathymetric layer extracted from ETOPO) with 11,566 km of that represented by the areas of overexploitation(combined Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Cuba).&#160;Therefore, it is inferred that the proportion of its population in the Gulf of Mexico that has experienced significant declines is likely to be less than half of the overall population.&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Stable,"<em>Mugil cephalus&#160;</em>is distributed circumglobally in shallow coastal waters&#160;of&#160;tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions from 51°N to 42°S.&#160;In the western Atlantic it is known from Nova Scotia, Canada south along the U.S. and throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Specimens previously identified as <em>M. cephalus</em> in the Caribbean and Brazil are no longer considered valid (Menezes <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is not present in the Bahamas or most of the West Indies (Robins and Ray 1986, McEachran and Fechhelm 1998). In the eastern Atlantic it is known from France, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and along West Africa to South Africa&#160;including the offshore islands.&#160;The population from Morocco to Angola is genetically different to those in the Mediterranean, with potentially two subpopulations present in Morocco (Whitfield<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).

Although this species may be experiencing localised declines in specific areas within its range, it remains widespread and abundant throughout its southern hemisphere range and is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","This&#160;is a semi catadromous galaxiid species that inhabits a wide range of low gradient coastal environments, including still or flowing waters such as streams, rivers and lakes (McDowall 2000).&#160;It can tolerate salinities of up to 50 ppt, however some populations are known to be landlocked (Gomon and Bray 2011).&#160;Unlike other galaxiids, this&#160;is a shoaling&#160;species and highly mobile as adults. Adults migrate downstream to estuaries to spawn, with a few hundred to a few thousand eggs being produced.&#160;Spawning requirements are very specific in terms of timing, vegetation and salinity characteristics, with spawning occurring on spring tides, amongst littoral vegetation and in freshwater but just upstream of estuarine saline wedges (Hicks<em> et al.</em> 2010). Larvae rear at sea and return to freshwater after 4-6 months as whitebait (at about 50-55 mm long) (McDowall 2000).&#160;Land-locked individuals migrate upstream to spawn in tributaries. Evidence from New Zealand suggests adults typically spawn in the same localities most years (Hickford and Schiel 2011). This species usually matures after about one year (although it can live for up to five years) and it usually dies after spawning. Adults typically&#160;reach a&#160;maximum total length of 80-120 mm, although specimens of up to 190 mm have been recorded (Gomon and Bray 2011). The average generation time is thought to be one year.","In New Zealand, the loss of rearing and spawning habitat due to land clearance, loss of river connectivity through tide and flood gates and stop banking, channelization, weirs, dams and land and wetland drainage has significantly reduced the distribution of this species. Loss of riparian vegetation (e.g. through stock trampling, grazing and mowing), is also a threat to spawning sites (Hickford and Schiel 2011).&#160;Prior to fishery regulations, the whitebait fishery in New Zealand also contributed to a major decline of this species. Predation by introduced salmonids is another potential threat to this species in New Zealand. The same threats are likely to exist in Australia but there has been no observed decline.<br/><br/>Information on threats throughout the rest of this species range is not known, however it remains abundant and widespread.","No information is available on the global population trend of this species.

It is represented by a large number of locations and occurrences. Total population size is likely very large. Localized or regional threats have likely resulted in population decline or extirpation at the local scale. However, total population size is likely declining at a rate that precludes it from being listed in a threatened category under criterion A. In much of its range, the population trend of <em>A. chrysogaster</em> remains stable. Given a broad distribution, large extent of occurrence and area of occupancy, and many locations, this species is assessed as Least Concern (LC). </p>","<p>This highly adaptable species occurs in diverse situations ranging from low-elevation desert streams to cool, clear mountain streams, generally at elevations below 1,500 meters in the north but ranging to 2,000 meters in the south (Lee et al. 1980). Typically it occurs in shallow sandy and rocky runs and flowing pools of creeks and small to medium rivers, often near cover (Page and Burr 2011), and in eddys and pools near overhanging banks or other cover. In the Gila River, New Mexico, it is distributed almost evenly throughout pools, glides, runs and riffles (Stefferud et al. 2011). During low water, individuals may take refuge in moist detritus and algal mats (Sublette et al. 1990). It is tolerant of high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen. Diet is comprised primarily of aquatic insects, benthic invertebrates, and algal material (Pilger et al. 2010). </p>  <p>Spawning occurs in shallow depressions in fine sand along shoreline at depths of 5-20 cm; eggs are buried by the spawning act (Johnston and Page 1992). Young remain in the nest until the yolk sac is mostly absorbed before moving to stream edges.</p>  <p>In Mexico, this species occurs throughout low altitude rivers and streams, generally in small clear ponds with low water flow, although it can also be found in fast flowing rivers. It generally inhabits shallow waters with sand bottoms and/or dense surrounding vegetation (Minckley &amp; Barber 1971, Varela Romero et al. in Ceballos et al. 2016).</p>","<p>Threats include habitat alterations and interactions with non-native fish species. Large areas of habitat have been destroyed by dewatering, stream diversion, groundwater pumping, dam construction, channel and watershed erosion, and other factors. Additional water development and ongoing watershed damage threaten large portions of the remaining range (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). In the Aravaipa Creek Canyon area, populations are threatened by over appropriation of aquifer water and the invasion of non-native fishes. The red shiner is present in the Gila River and has been suggested as a potential competitor for native species (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1997). Additionally, the established piscivorous flathead catfish <em>Pylodictus olivarus</em> may prey on this species in the Gila River (Hedden et al. 2016). The listing priority form of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1994) considered the degree of threat to be moderate to low. A recent modelling study by Ruhi et al. (2017) suggests a 45% chance of quasi-extinction (an 80% reduction in total population size) within the next ten years in Arizona and New Mexico, resulting primarily from streamflow reduction. </p><p></p><p>In Mexico, the Longfin Dace is susceptible to human activities. Urbanization, agriculture, dam construction and pollution are factors that directly affect this species' habitat and could be causing its populations to decrease and migrate into more secluded ponds and streams.

The Texas Natural History Collection index of North American freshwater fishes (TNHC 1996) mapped a total of 84 records from approximately seven drainages with 29 records from Mexico, seven records from New Mexico, and 48 records from Arizona. Lee et al. (1980) mapped about 165 records from approximately seven drainages with 47 records from Mexico, 18 records from New Mexico, and 100 records from Arizona. The difference in the numbers of records on the two maps may simply represent a combining of records on the TNHC map; the overall distributions are similar.</p>  <p>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably exceeds 100,000. Minckley and Marsh (2009) regarded this fish to be relatively abundant. New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (1997) considered the species to be locally abundant in small streams. In Arizona, this species is abundant in the intermittent lower reaches of the Big Sandy and Santa Maria rivers (Pool and Olden 2015). </p>  <p>Declines have occurred, but the species remains widespread and abundant (Minckley and Marsh 2009).

Spawning occurs in quiet waters of lakes or streams, often over sunfish nests, clean gravel or sand of riffles, submerged roots or logs, or aquatic plants, or on rocky shorelines in crevices. Eggs sink and adhere to bottom (gravel, sand, or mud). Male defends spawning territory.","No major threats are known.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>blairi </em>from Maravillas Creek drainage in the Big Bend region of Texas apparently is extinct, possibly through the effects of introduced <em>Fundulus zebrinus</em> (Miller et al. 1989, Matthews 1987).","The total population size of this species is unknown.

129987081,62201,Gila robusta,Vulnerable,A2ce,2019,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The historical range of <em>Gila robusta</em> includes the Colorado River and its tributaries from southwestern Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado southward to the Little Colorado River confluence in Arizona, south of which it occurred only in primary tributaries of the Colorado River. Southward range extent included much of the Bill Williams and Gila drainages in Arizona, and occasionally into northern Sonora, Mexico. On a range-wide scale, occurrence of <em>G. robusta</em> has been reduced by approximately 50% from its historic distribution, much of which occurred between 1970-1990. Major threats include interactions of watershed changes, such as reductions in suitable habitat due to impoundment, flow regulation, channel downcutting, water diversion, and groundwater pumping, with the invasion of non-native predatory and competitive fish species. These major pervasive threats have not ceased. Given past range-wide documented reductions of 50%, and basin-wide reductions of up to 82% (in the lower Colorado River Basin), range-wide population reduction over three generations (17-23 years) is suspected to be between 30-50% based on a decline in the area of occupancy and habitat quality, in addition to the negative effects of introduced taxa and competitors. As such, <em>G. robusta</em> is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2.","<p>This species' habitat includes rocky runs, rapids, and pools of creeks and small to large rivers, also large reservoirs in the upper Colorado River system; generally this species prefers cobble-rubble, sand-cobble, or sand-gravel substrate. Adults are associated with the largest, most permanent water in streams (Minckley 1981), where a few deep (greater than 1 meter) pools with cover (boulders, woody debris) are intermixed with riffles, runs, and eddies (Bestgen and Propst 1989, Propst 1999, White 2005). Large populations often occur in pools behind irrigation diversions (Barber and Minckley 1966). This species is less prone to using cover than are close congeners; they typically frequent open areas in the deepest pools and eddies of middle sized to larger streams (Minckley and DeMarais 2000).<br/><br/>Eggs are scattered over clean gravel or cobble substrates (sometimes sand and silt) of pools with moderate velocity runs and generally at least 25 cm deep (Neve 1976, Minckley 1981, Sublette <em>et al. </em>1990).</p>","<p>Threats include interactions of watershed changes, such as reductions in suitable habitat due to impoundment, flow regulation, channel downcutting, substrate sedimentation (e.g. from excessive livestock grazing, timber harvest, road construction, removal of riparian vegetation), water diversion, and groundwater pumping, with the invasion of non-native predatory and competitive fish species (Hubbs 1954, Miller 1961, Minckley and Deacon 1968, Meffe 1985). The Oriental snail also has been named as a detrimental introduced species. Watershed changes and the introduction of non-native fishes often have occurred concurrently, making it difficult to determine the primary cause of the decline. Historical fish eradication programs conducted in association with dam construction are likely to have played a role in the decline in some areas. Water quality degradation (contaminants, nutrients, pathogens) possibly may also contribute to declines or poor habitat conditions (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1996, Carman 2006).<br/><br/>Vanicek and Kramer (1969) reported that reductions in river temperature attributable to Flaming Gorge Dam had negatively impacted the spawning success of <em>Gila</em> species. On the other hand, habitat changes that raise water temperatures could result in mortality. Deacon and Minckley (1974) reported heat deaths at 30.5 <sup>o</sup>C in pools of the Salt River, Arizona.<br/><br/>Minckley (1973) correlated a proliferation of Smallmouth Bass with a suppression of reproductive success by <em>G. robusta</em> in tributaries of the Salt and Black Rivers, Arizona. Bestgen and Propst (1989) blamed an introduced predatory fauna, including Channel Catfish, Flathead Catfish, Smallmouth Bass, and possibly Rainbow and Brown Trouts, for reductions in populations in the Gila River, New Mexico. In Turkey Creek, New Mexico, the species remains common above a barrier that prevents upstream migration of introduced predatory fishes but have steadily declined below the barrier where Smallmouth Bass are common (Bestgen and Propst 1989). Bestgen and Propst (1989) also blamed drought and introduced predators for extirpations from the San Francisco River, New Mexico.<br/><br/>The importance in retaining a natural flow regime in southwestern streams has been emphasized repeatedly (e.g. see Meffe and Minckley 1987 and Minckley and Meffe 1987). Native fishes usually survive flooding, whereas non-native fishes generally do not. In the San Juan and Gila drainages of New Mexico, <em>G. robusta</em> persists where non-native predators are absent or where natural flow regimes and periodic flooding might act to suppress populations of introduced predators and maintain habitat variability (Bestgen and Propst 1989). Also, recruitment of individuals to age 1 appears to be dependent on late winter/early spring floods (Brouder 2001).</p>","<p>This species is represented by a fairly large number of occurrences (subpopulations). Stratification of recent collection locations using existing migration barriers and suitable habitat yielded 15 preliminary populations of <em>G. robusta</em> in the Colorado River basin (Bezzerides and Bestgen 2002). Some of these occupy very large areas.<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but likely exceeds 10,000.<br/><br/>Today, <em>G. robusta</em> occupy only about 45 percent of the historical range in the Colorado River basin (Bezzerides and Bestgen 2002). The species currently occupies about 18 percent of its historical range in the lower Colorado River basin (Voeltz 2002, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2016). In Black Rocks, Colorado, populations have remained relatively stable in recent years (Francis<em> et al. </em>2016). Given these documented range-wide reductions in occupancy, it is suspected that population reduction has occurred in the past<br/><br/>In most areas where this species persists, abundance has been much reduced. Sampling from 1999-2012 in the San Juan River report this species as extremely rare (Franssen <em>et al.</em> 2015), but others report likely extirpation (Bezzerides and Bengsten 2002, UDNR 2006). In the upper Gila River, population decline is likely due to the competitive or predatory effects of non-native species; only one individual was collected from six sites across a 19 year sampling period (Propst <em>et al.</em> 2008). It may now be extirpated in the Gila River drainage, and is considered extirpated from the Zuni and San Francisco River drainages (New Mexico Department of Fish and Game 2016).<br/><br/>In Arizona, <em>G. robusta</em> occupies 1841 linear km of stream habitat and 38 unique streams, which is 21.6% of total stream habitat in the state (Turner and List 2007). In Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, this species comprises a minor proportion of relative abundance (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2003). In the Upper Bill Williams River Basin, <em>G. robusta</em> populations have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years (Pool and Olden 2015).<br/><br/>Population trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain but suspected to be in decline. Age at first reproduction occurs between years 3 and 5, with an average longevity of 8-10 years (USFWS 2015). Given these parameters and an estimated <em>z</em> of 0.5, three generations is estimated at 17-23 years. Most of the decline likely occurred more than 20 years ago (probably in the 1960s and 1970s). It is likely that a total range-wide population reduction of 30% or greater occurred between 1950-1970 or 1970-1990.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The historical range of <em>Gila robusta</em> includes the Colorado River and its tributaries from southwestern Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado southward to the Little Colorado River confluence in Arizona, south of which the species occurred only in primary tributaries of the Colorado River (Carman 2006). The southward range extent included much of the Bill Williams and Gila drainages, Arizona; occasionally this species may have occupied the Colorado River delta in northern Sonora and Baja California (Minckley and Marsh 2009). Additionally, a taxonomically confusing population (usually known as <em>Gila robusta jordani</em>) occurs along the White River, Nevada. Current overall range is similar, but the species no longer occurs in much of the formerly occupied area.<br/><br/>In the upper Colorado River basin, extirpations have occurred in the Price River and portions of the San Juan, Gunnison, and Green rivers (Bezzerides and Bestgen 2002, UDNR 2006). In the lower Colorado River basin, extirpations have occurred in the San Francisco River, the San Pedro River, and the Colorado River and tributaries in Grand Canyon and downstream (Bezzerides and Bestgen 2002, UDNR 2006). Many of these extirpations occurred between 1970-1990, with the onset of dam closures and introductions of non-native predators (Bezzerides and Bestgen 2002).<br/><br/>In Wyoming, this species occurs in tributaries to the Green River and in several lakes in the upper portion of the basin. Extant but declining populations in Utah occur in the Escalante and San Rafael rivers, the middle and upper San Juan River (including some tributaries), in the Colorado River from Moab to Silt, in the Fremont River, in the Green River from the Colorado River confluence upstream to Sand Wash and from Jensen to Echo Park, in the White River from the Green River confluence upstream to near Meeker, and in the Duchesne River from the Green River confluence upstream to Myton (UDNR 2006).<br/><br/>Certain populations in the northern and eastern Gila River basin of Arizona and New Mexico (formerly included in <em>G. robusta</em>) are now recognized as a distinct species (<em>Gila nigra</em>) (Minckley and DeMarais 2000).

As such, <em>R. osculus</em> is assessed as Least Concern</p>","<p><em>Rhinichthys osculus</em> occurs in many kinds of habitats: riffles, runs, and pools of cool flowing headwaters, creeks, and small to medium rivers with mostly rocky substrates; large and small lakes (rarely); warm, permanent and intermittent streams; and outflows of desert springs (Moyle 1976); usually found in shallow water (averaging about 0.5 m deep or less); in streams, often congregates below riffles and eddies (Minckley 1973). Young tend to occupy edges of streams in slower, shallow water (Cross 1975). Larger adults generally are in relatively quiet water where cover (e.g., overhanging trees, deadfalls, boulders) is available (Minckley 1985). <br/> <br/> Stream populations spawn in swift water over rocky substrates. Lake populations spawn in shallow waters with gravel substrate or on gravel edge of riffles in inlet streams (Moyle 1976). In Aravaipa Creek, Arizona, spawning occurred over rapids and riffles at depths less than 25 cm over substrates of gravel, cobble, or rubble (Minckley 1981). <br/> <br/> Mueller (1984) described spawning behavior of speckled dace in the San Francisco River, New Mexico. Spawning occurred in a 1-m square section of stream recently scoured by human activity. Spawning clusters formed, each with more than 25 fish. Dace thrashed violently (presumable at spawning) and eggs were found at depths to 5 cm. Most eggs were unexposed, attached to undersides of rocks or in interstices between rocks. Territoriality or spawning pairs were not observed. <br/> <br/> In the Virgin River (Utah, Arizona, Nevada), <em>R. osculus </em>were collected from 500 m to 1800 m elevation (Cross 1975).

Seventy percent were collected near some type of cover, usually overhanging trees, deadfalls, and boulders.

It is a highly commercial species throughout much of its range and supports some of the largest global fisheries. Data from available assessments  (spawning stock biomass, survey catch rates, landings data, etc.) show some indication of decline over the past 10 years (3 generation lengths); however, this species naturally exhibits large and drastic fluctuations which can be attributed to long-term, regional climatic and environmental conditions and therefore, it is difficult to infer declines based on the available time series. Although this species abundance is currently at historic lows in some regions (e.g., the U.S.; southern Africa; and Japan), it appears to be moderately exploited and is well managed throughout its global range. Therefore, <em>Sardinops sagax</em> is globally assessed as Least Concern. However, overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during periods of high abundance, which can result in extended periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions in areas which generally have viable fisheries. This risk, identified over decades of research and monitoring of the world's major <em>S. sagax</em> fisheries, is now well recognized by regulators and managed accordingly, though localized caution is warranted in areas with consistently high fishing pressure.","<p>This is a marine, pelagic and migratory species forming large shoals that may spread over several kilometres (Whitehead 1985). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of sardine stocks associated with changes in population size show a similar pattern in all subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009) and are thought to be closely influenced by prevailing winds, currents and local phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations (Munroe 2016). For example, spawning grounds have been completely abandoned as subpopulations decrease in size, or colonized as the subpopulation size increases, or both (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). Similarly, the diets of all five subpopulations show some variation but are generally similar throughout; this species primarily feeds on zooplankton, mostly small crustaceans (i.e., copepods, ostracods, euphausiids and mysids), but also feeds on mollusc larvae and phytoplankton (i.e., diatoms: Whitehead 1985). Individuals reach maturity between 1 – 2 years of age; it is thought that a majority spawn at age 2 (Whitehead 1985). Spawning changes geographically within and between regions but is generally in the winter and spring months of the geographic region with the period extending into summer months in some regions (e.g., off Australia and New Zealand: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>Geographic variations in some biological characteristics have also been observed within and between subpopulations, such as maximum size, longevity and depth, as well as preferred spawning habitat. In general, this species is known to a maximum of 36 cm standard length, but is more commonly found to be about 18 - 25 cm; subpopulations in the eastern Pacific are typically larger than the others (Whitehead 1985). Funamoto (2018) reports the subpopulation in the northwestern Pacific (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum longevity of 7 years; Whitehead (1985) reported the northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has a maximum longevity of about 25 years. This species is known from depths up to 40 – 200 m (Whitehead 1985, Munroe 2016). Available information related to spawning habitat from each geographically separated subpopulation is variable, but suggests that this species uses either inshore (bays and coastal waters) and/or offshore (~ 80 km offshore with depths up to 5,000 m) areas to spawn (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al.</em> 2007). </p>    <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>  <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has the longest estimated maximum longevity (20 – 25 years) and the largest measured maximum standard length (36 cm), but is usually found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation mainly matures within 1 - 2 years and breeds in late winter to early summer months (January – June) with peak spawning in April – May (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation migrates northward during summer months between California and British Columbian waters, and returns southward in autumn and winter months to spawn off the southern California coast (~ 80 km offshore), between the Point of Conception and San Diego (Whitehead 1985), possibly extending to southern Baja, California (Kramer 1970, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Spawning takes place during the night and individuals produce pelagic eggs (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is known to a maximum standard length of 30 cm, but is more commonly found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This species can be found down to depths of at least 40 m (Whitehead 1985). It is known to breed twice in one season (at least off Chile), mostly between July – September (Whitehead 1985). The spawning period can extend between February – March, though this is less common (Whitehead 1985). This species forms large schools in the Peru Current (Whitehead 1985). Large southward geographical range shifts of this subpopulation have been observed in association with El Niño event (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Evidence available from years not affected by El Niño events suggest an abundance of sardines in northern Chile have a seasonal pattern, with peak abundances occurring during the winter spawning season and much lower abundances during summer and fall (Serra and Tsukayama 1988, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>    <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 32 cm based on an individual collected from the Shimane Prefecture, Japan (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018), but is more commonly found to 15 – 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). Individuals in this region reach maturity at age 2 and breed in winter and spring months from about November to the beginning of May; in the southern portion of the northwestern Pacific range, this species spawns in the earlier months of the spawning period (Whitehead 1985). Peak spawning is thought to take place in February (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007); eggs are most abundant between February and March (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). Spawning mainly takes place along the Pacific coast of Japan and has been observed inshore in protected bays, in the surface waters of open seas and in offshore waters over bottom depth of up to 5,000 m (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). This migratory species tends to move northward and inshore in the summer months, returning southward and more offshore in the winter months (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 21.3 cm, but is more commonly found to 18 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation reaches maturity between 8 – 13 cm standard length throughout most of its range; individuals off New Zealand are reported to reach maturity at 12 cm SL or above (Whitehead 1985). It is thought that the subpopulation off Australia breeds throughout its entire geographical range, but at different times (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989); in the southern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the spring and summer months (September – February), whereas in the northern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the winter months (June – August: Whitehead 1985). In contrast, off New Zealand spawning is concentrated in the area between the North and South Islands (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). This species forms large school at the surface during the spawning periods and when juveniles leave sheltered bays to join adult schools (i.e., southern New South Wales: Whitehead 1985). </p>    The southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus </em>or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is known to maximum standard length of 28 cm, but is more commonly found to 25 cm (Whitehead 1985). This is a highly migratory species (though the northern stock perhaps rarely moves south of the Orange River) that prefers the cooler, coastal waters of the southwestern African shelf (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation primarily spawns between September – April and is known to breed either offshore (January – March) or inshore (September – December: Munroe 2016).","The larger subpopulations of this species seem to naturally undergo drastic population fluctuations due to inter-annual, annual and long-term climactic changes resulting in large range contractions and expansions over time (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of subpopulations show a similar pattern in each isolated region where this species has been heavily exploited (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Barange <em>et al. </em>2009); overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during times of high abundance. Periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions result in fishery collapse in areas which generally have viable fisheries (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Given this species has an anti-tropical geographical distribution and prefers cooler waters, a global increase in average sea surface temperature (SST) may result in prolonged or permanent range contractions in all isolated regions, though more research is needed to determine the extent this may affect this species.","Landings of <em>Sardinops sagax</em> are reported to the FAO as three nominal species: <em>S. sagax</em>, which represents subpopulations off Australia, and in the eastern Pacific off the western coasts of North and South America; <em>S. ocellatus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off South Africa; and <em>S. melanostictus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off Japan. Globally, combined landings of the three nominal species average just over 6.5 million tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 with a peak of 25 million tonnes in 1985 (FAO 2016). Catch reconstructions are available for <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (1950 - 2010) which appear to encompass global catches and report lower annual catches, averaging just over 3.7 million tonnes annually, but otherwise track very closely with landings reported to the FAO (Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches show a sharp increasing trend between 1970 and the mid-1980s followed by peak landings between about 1984 - 1988; a maximum of about 25 million tonnes was reported to the FAO in 1985 (FAO 2016). Following 1988, landings and reconstructed catches declined to quantities similar to historical values (&lt; 5 million tonnes) by the late 1990s, and continued to decline below historical catches until the end of the available time series (2010 for reconstructed catches and 2014 for reported landings: FAO 2016, Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>According to Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), previous theoretical considerations and attempts to find discrete genetic stocks suggest it is unlikely that this species can be subdivided into genetically definable stocks within the individual current systems. However, more recent work has been completed (e.g., Schwartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999, Miller 2006, Ohshimo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Roux <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160; Demer and Zwolinski 2014, van der Lingen <em>et al. </em>2015, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) to suggest otherwise; at least two or three stocks are recognized in each current system where this species occurs (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Subpopulation-specific information</strong><br/><em><br/>Northeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (northern Mexico to southern Alaska), southern (Baja Peninsula  to southern California) and Gulf of California (Baldwin <em>et al. </em>2012,  Demer and Zwolinski 2014, Izzo<em> et al.</em> 2017). The northern and southern units appear to move north and south along the coast in  synchrony, but spawn in separate localities and seasons (Garcia-marales  <em>et al.</em> 2012, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an important commercial fishery for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Current subpopulation information is limited. Previously, the subpopulation collapsed in the 1950s and early 1960s resulting in a large contraction of its geographical range; it was virtually absent from waters north of Point Conception (34°N) until the 1980s. A minor recovery of the subpopulation increased its range as far north as San Francisco (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). A recent trawl survey (2001) indicated that this species was largely concentrated offshore between San Francisco and the Point of Conception (33 and 38°N: Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). In April of 2011, total biomass of the subpopulation was estimated to be ~ 0.494 million metric tonnes (Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Independent surveys conducted by the U.S. and British Columbia have reported a significant decrease in sardine biomass (DFO 2011) and spawning stock biomass since 2006 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Spawning stock biomass has reached historically low levels in recent years (2014 - 2017: Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Total coast wide biomass in has declined by ~57% and ~ 79% between 2006 and 2010 in U.S. and Canadian waters, respectively (DFO 2011). The observed decrease in biomass coincided with unusual ocean conditions which may have affected overall abundance and distribution (DFO 2011), similar to other global subpopulations of this species. Recruitment in U.S. waters has also declined since 2005 - 2006 with the exception of a brief period of modest recruitment in 2009 - 2010; a small increase in recruitment was observed in 2016 but the estimate is highly variable and based off limited data (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). The 2001 - 2015 year classes have been among the weakest observed in recent history (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Exploitation rates of this species in U.S. waters have averaged about 11 % since 2005 with peak of 13% in 2013; both the U.S. and total exploitation rates of this species in northern U.S. were less than 1%&#160; in 2016 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><em>Southeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as<em> S. sagax sensu stricu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (southern Ecuador to central Peru), central (southern Peru to northern Chile), and southern (off Chile: Schartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999). In this region, this species is a dominant small pelagic resource along with the engraulid, <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(Passuni <em>et al. </em>2018) where it is known to undergo periods of high and low abundance, similar to other global subpopulations. Landings reported to the FAO (1950 - 2014) from the southeast Pacific are presumably referring to this subpopulation and are driven by landings from Peru and Chile with an average of 1.1 million tonnes (FAO 2016). The trend in reported landings tracks very closely with the global trends in landings of this species and is represented by a sharp increase between 1970 and the early 1980s followed by a peak in 1985 (~6.5 million tonnes) and a sharp decline until 2014, the most recent year available in the time series (936 tonnes: FAO 2016).<br/><br/><em>Northwestern Pacific </em>- This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is further subdivided into two units: one which occupies the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, and another which occurs along the Pacific coast (Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In this region, this species is important to fisheries and has experienced wide fluctuations similar to other global subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Declines in landings were reported in the 1940s and the fishery was greatly reduced in the northern portion of its range (e.g., Honshu and Hokkaido) and was primarily restricted to the western Sea of Japan and East China Sea (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The contraction of spawning grounds was also observed during this time (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The subpopulation reportedly recovered in the 1970's and expanded its spawning habitat to encompass grounds around southern Kyushu (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989), specifically including Tanegashima Island, Osumi Islands (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018). The population in the NW Pacific has shown a continuous decline from about 1987 - 2003 (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Biomass decreased from ~14 - 19 million tons in the 1980s to less than 1 million tons in the late 1990s; biomass remains at very low levels in the most recent years available (2005: Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, egg abundance has declined by at least an order of magnitude from the 1980s to the early 2000s; juvenile abundance has also declined since the mid-1990s (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/><em>Southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) is further subdivided into at least four units with some degree of overlap: southwestern coast (off Western Australia), Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf, Bass Strait and Port Phillip Bay (off Victoria and Tasmania), and eastern Australia; additional evidence exists for the subdivision of units off Western Australia and the east coast (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species is important to fisheries off Australian and New Zealand waters. Catches have increased since the beginning of the available time series (1975) with some fluctuation (Ward <em>et al. </em>2014a, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches peaked off Western Australia in the 1990s (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) but have remained at low levels over the last two decades following two mass mortality events which impacted the entire population in the mid - late 1990's (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whittington <em>et al.</em> 2008). A recent stock assessment off South Australia was conducted and indicated that catch and effort has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 after the establishment of a large fishery in 1991 (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017); it is possible that the increase in catch is also associated with high abundance years in this region. For example, the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) has increased over the last decade from 30,000 t in 2007 - 2009, to 42,750 t in 2017; total annual catches in South Australian waters have also increased (~30,000 t in 2007 to ~38,000 t in 2016: Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Significant catches in Australia have been taken from New South Wales, Victoria and in Commonwealth waters (Ward&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b), though a large majority of catch in this region is taken from South Australia (specifically Spencer Gulf), which represents only a small portion of this species total range (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017); there is concern regarding the potential local depletion in the Spencer Gulf (Izzo <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The fishery in South Australia (Spencer Gulf) was established in 1991 and is currently the largest fishery by volume in the country (Total Allowable Catch in 2016 was 38,000 t: Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Effort has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging from ~760 to 1100 net-sets per year (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual CPUE have risen from ~30 t/set-net in 2007 to over 40 t/set-net in 2015 and 2016 (Ward<em> et al.</em> 2017). The estimated spawning stock biomass for 2017 was estimated to be between 236,00 t - 305,000 t and is the largest obtained for the southern stock of sardine in Australian waters; the southern stock is classified as sustainable as the spawning biomass for 2017 exceeds the target reference point of 150,000 t in the harvest strategy for the South Australian Sardine Fishery (SASF: Ward <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/><em>Southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus</em> or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is further subdivided into at least two units: northern (Namibia) and southern (South Africa); additionally, the southern unit is broken down further into three subunits: east of Agulhas Bank, west of Agulhas Bank, and off KwaZulu-Natal (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2006, Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Okomadu 2017). Limited information is available related to this subpopulation, though it is commercially important and reported to follow similar boom-bust patterns of the other four global subpopulations. This species supports a major fishery in African waters and has largely experienced major fluctuations in catches (Okumadu 2017). Off Namibia, the biomass of this unit crashed in the late 1960's; a slight recovery was observed in the 1990's but various stresses (e.g., heavy fishing pressure and abnormal environmental conditions such as hypoxia and the Benguela El Niño) caused a further decline in biomass and catches (Okumadu 2017). Presently, low sardine biomass can only allow limited fishing activity (Okumadu 2017). Within South Africa, the small pelagic fishery which targets this unit is the largest commercial fishery by volume and the second largest in net value (Okumadu 2017). The South African Sardine purse seine fishery has been concentrated along the western coast since the 1940's (Okumadu 2017). This species has undergone wide fluctuations in abundance since the beginning of industrial-scale fishing (Okumadu 2017). Similar to Namibia, high sardine catches taken in South Africa in the early 1960s were followed by drastic declines (Okumadu 2017); a slow recovery followed after management measures were put in place in the mid - 1980s (Okumadu 2017). A slight increase in biomass and catches between 2001 and 2005 (~ 4 million tonnes) resulted from good recruitment; however poor recruitment in 2004 has led to another substantial decrease in biomass in recent years (~ 250,000 tonnes in 2007 - 2008: Okumadu 2017) and has remained at a low biomass since about 2006 (DAFF 2016). In 2015, the Total Allowable Catch for this species was set below 90,000 t for the first time since 1997 which represents its depleted state in South African waters (DAFF 2016). <br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span style=""""><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Unknown,"<em>Sardinops sagax </em>exhibits an antitropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations that were given taxonomic names at some time in their history. Based on Whitehead (1985) and Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), the distributions of these five subpopulations are as follows. In the eastern Pacific, this species occurs from southeastern Alaska, south to Baja California, including the Gulf of California (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>), and from Peru to Chile including the Galapagos Islands (referred to as&#160;<em>S. sagax sensu strictu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>). In the northwestern Pacific, it occurs from Peter the Great Bay, Russia, south to at least Taiwan; H. Hata (<em>pers. comm.</em> 2018) reports it to be widely distributed throughout Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu, but does not occur off the Ryukyu Islands (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>). In the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific, this species occurs from Shark Bay, Western Australia to the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland and New Zealand (referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>). In the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian, this species occurs from Baia dos Tigres, Angola to Durban, South Africa&#160; (referred to as&#160;<em>S. ocellatus</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>); more recent records report this species from Madagascar (Fricke <em>et al.</em> 2018) and the Macarenes (Fricke 1999).&#160;This species occurs in coastal waters to a depth of about 200 m<span style=""""> (Munroe 2016)<span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>","<p>In general, this species is one of the most important commercial fishes throughout a large portion of its range. It is caught with purse seine, trawls, gill nets and beach seines. Pilchards are marketed fresh, frozen or canned and used for fish meal and fish oil (Munroe 2016). Historically, the five subpopulations contributed about one-quarter of all clupeoid fishes caught making this the most productive out of all clupeoid genera (more than 8 million tonnes in 1983: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>    <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is fished by Canada, the United States and Mexic<span style="""">o (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Landings declined and a fishing moratorium was put in place in the late 1960s (Whitehead 1985) which was reopened in the 1980s. More recently, catches decreased by approximately 95% (1.8 million mt – 86,000 mt) off the U.S. coast between the years 2006 – 2017 warranting current fishery closures in this region (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).</span> </p>  <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) undergoes large southward geographical range shifts during El Niño years; Ecuadorian and Peruvian fisheries can experience drastic declines as this species migrates out of available fishing zones (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). It is not uncommon for total catch to exceed 1 – 2 million tons annually (Whitehead 1985). A majority of catch (~90%) is utilized for fishmeal for fish oil, ~ 4% is canned and the remaining quantity is marketed fresh or frozen (Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is one of the most commercially important fishes in Japan with record catches exceeding 4 million tons (Whitehead 1985). Observed catches declined sharply in the 1940s; however catches in this geographical region, as in others, generally show notable fluctuations (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>  <p>Compared to other subpopulations, no globally significant fishery has existed for the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) off Australia and New Zealand (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). However, based on a recent stock assessment off southern Australia, catch and effort for this species has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 (Ward <em>et al. </em>2017) to be regionally important. It is commonly used as fishing bait and fodder for aquaculture, and is taken with purse seine nets (Whitehead 1985, D.

Gaughan <em>pers. obs. </em>2001).</p>",Marine,"No known species-specific conservation measures are currently in place globally, though its total distribution overlaps with existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). Regional fishery management initiatives (i.e., yearly monitoring, stock assessments, quotas, limited entry fisheries and seasonal closures) are in place and implemented to a varying degree (Barange <em>et al. </em>2009) throughout most of it range, especially in Australia (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the United States (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018). Off California, fishing moratoriums have been put in place for this species during the 1960s - 1980s (Whitehead 1985), and more recently in 2015 - 2017 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018).",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,Global
154801652,195502,Anguilla australis,Near Threatened,NA,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla australis</em> is a catadromous, semelparous species with multiple life stages, and is assumed to be panmictic.&#160;These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Ideally, the IUCN Red List criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, to silver eels starting their spawning migration, as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but such data sets are rarely available. Analysis conducted on fisheries and monitoring data for glass eels, yellow eels and silver eels were reviewed, although the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List criteria must be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the current best estimate of the population status.</p><p><em>A. australis</em> is found in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and surrounding islands (Ege 1939, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2010). Current fisheries-dependent data is available for both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, <em>A. australis</em> is most commonly found in Victoria and Tasmania, where it constitutes the majority of fisheries catch at yellow eel and silver eel life stages (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009, VFA 2017). In Victoria, catch was described as having increased from 1978 to 1993, after which declines were observed in western regions between the late 1990s and early 2000s, attributed to “Millennium Drought” reducing harvestable waters (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). Eel fisheries in Victoria and Queensland are highly restricted and are confined to private and a small number of public impoundments stocked with wild-caught juvenile eels solely for grow-out purposes (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012, VFA 2017). This fishery data for adult eels is therefore not representative of wild eels and cannot be used to infer trends for the purpose of a conservation assessment. Also, with no metric of effort, there is increased uncertainty relating to abundance trends inferred from the reported data. In Tasmania, fishing effort data is collected, although it has not yet been reported (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). In New Zealand, reported catch is primarily of yellow eels, as there is no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora, and catch of glass eels is mostly prohibited. The North Island Eel Statistical Areas (ESAs) with available data showed either declines or no trend from when data gathering began in 1990 up to 2002, after which increasing trends in CPUE were observed (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). In the South Island, ESAs with available data showed initial declines in the series prior to the introduction of the Quota Management System (QMS) in 2000, after which CPUE showed an increasing trend (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). </p><p>Fishery-independent data is also available for this species. Recruitment of glass eels to the Waikato River in the North Island of New Zealand appears to have declined within the last 30 years or 1.5 generation lengths (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Sampling in the 2004-05 season found CPUE to have decreased by ~66% since sampling in the 1970s. However, a lack of continuous monitoring, with the most recent sampling only occurring over two years, combined with interannual variability in recruitment, makes drawing conclusions from this data difficult. Regular sampling of glass eels at sites across New Zealand from 1995–2006, showed evidence of increases of <em>A. australis</em> (Jellyman 2012). <em>A. australis</em> elver recruitment data from 1995–2015 in New Zealand has been highly variable, and in some areas shown an increase (Martin and Bowman 2016). The relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it is generally agreed that low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement. A study of size distribution of eels also found <em>A. australis</em> to show a healthy distribution, with larger proportions of small eels being present, compared to larger eels (Jellyman 2012). Records from 1977–2015 collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) (in Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016) found an increase in the occurrence of <em>A. australis </em>over this period, although records were mostly from electrofishing, which may over-represent life stages in stream habitats accessible to this method (Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>There are a variety of documented threats to <em>A. australis</em>, and the life history characteristics of anguillids make them inherently more susceptible to these. In New Zealand, drainage between 1840s to 1970s has caused a reduction of wetland habitat by 85%, and as <em>A. australis</em> shows preference for lower reaches, estuaries and coastal areas, this has resulted in widespread habitat loss for this species (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). Also, flood pumping stations control water levels in lowlands where <em>A. australis</em> is commonly found, which can cause significant mortality to eels when sucked into pump intakes (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Across this species’ range, poor water management, including excessive surface and groundwater use, river channelisation, land clearance, and nutrient run-off, have been, and in some cases, will continue to be, detrimental to this species (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999, PCE 2013, Jellyman 2016). Recurring drought in Victoria has resulted in a significant number of eel deaths – mainly <em>A. australis</em> – from both stock enhanced culture waters and of wild-caught stock. In some lakes, eels have been totally eradicated (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a,b</em>). Rainfall is also predicted to be reduced by 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), and so this threat is likely to continue, if not worsen.</p><p>Based on available information across this species’ range, <em>A. australis</em> has been listed as Near Threatened. There is evidence of historical declines in recruitment - recent data suggests increasing trends in yellow eel, silver eel, and glass eel abundance but this is only over the period of around one generation length. The extent of habitat loss across this species’ range, however, is serious cause for concern. In New Zealand, there has been a significant reduction in wetland habitat, and severe drought conditions in Australia have caused shallow lakes to become hypersaline. As reduced rainfall is predicted in southeastern Australia, this may impact this species in the future. This, coupled with other ongoing threats, such as; mortality of eels at pumping stations, habitat degradation, poor water management, and the potential for increased fishery dependency on <em>A. australis</em> owing to reduced quota of the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, requires a precautionary assessment to be made over the period of three generation lengths. It is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. <a name=""_Hlk4155898"">As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation. </a></p><p>          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers, and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>A. australis </em>is principally a lowland species, inhabiting low lakes, estuaries, river reaches and wetlands, closer to coastal areas (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2006, Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). They have been known to migrate further inland, and it is hypothesised that the extent of <em>A. australis</em> found upstream is more a matter of suitable available, or accessible, habitat rather than migration ability (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the Southern coastal region of New South Wales for example, <em>A. australis</em> can be found in highland montane communities, at elevations greater than 700 m (Gehrke and Harris 2000). There is some overlap between the habitat of <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Arai <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sagar <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jellyman 2012). Habitat preferences for juveniles of both species include shallow (&lt;0.5 m) water, although <em>A. australis</em> prefers slow moving water (&lt;0.5 m/s) (Jellyman 2007, 2012). <em>A. australis</em> adults prefer deep water, still with slow velocity (Jellyman 2007, 2012). Substrate preferences differ between these species, with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> preferring course substrate as opposed to the fine muddy substrate that is preferred by <em>A. australis</em> (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998; Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). <em>A. australis</em> is the smallest growing of the three Australasian species, with a maximum length of 1.1 m, and weighing up to 3 kg (Jellyman 2012). Somatic growth rates of silver <em>A. australis</em> ranges from 14.4 to 56.6 mm/year and in general is faster than the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004). Growth rates of <em>A. australis</em> in New Zealand vary between the North and South Islands (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On the South Island, it is found to take on average 12.8 years to reach the minimum legal size of 220 g, whereas on the North Island it is found to take 5.8 years (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <em>A. australis</em> is a nocturnal feeder, with a diet consisting of benthic macroinvertebrates (Jellyman 1989, Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005), and individuals &gt;50–70 mm being known to be piscivorous (Ryan 1986 in Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jellyman 1989). There is diet overlap between <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, so the main mechanism thought to reduce intraspecific competition between the species is through different habitat preferences (Sagar <em>et al.</em> 2005). <em>A. reinhardtii</em> also shows overlap with <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in life history, although more so with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in ecology (Chisnall 2000).</p><p><em>A. australis </em>is catadromous, residing in continental waters before embarking on a seaward migration to spawn (Graynoth <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Studies using otolith microchemistry have found <em>A. australis </em>to exhibit behavioural plasticity in regard to life history, with an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004). <em>A. australis</em> is shorter lived than <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Age at spawning migration varies depending on growth rates, with males ranging between 5–22 years, at a size of 40–48 cm, and females 9–41 years and 64–80 cm (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although, Boubée <em>et al. </em>(2008) stated <em>A. australis</em> could migrate up to 60 years of age. A review by Jellyman (2007), estimated mean age of silver <em>A. australis </em>females in various regions across the North and South Islands. Values varied from 15 to 40 years, with a mean age across the regions of 23.8, although more data were available for the South Island where growth is slower (Jellyman 2007). Assessment of available data on generation length highlighted that factors such as longitude and latitude, sex and habitat quality can affect this metric. Twenty years was agreed upon after analysis. Crook <em>et al.</em> (2014) investigated environmental cues affecting migration of <em>A. australis </em>by tagging<em> </em>97 yellow eels, 23 of which migrated from freshwater to estuary (Darlots Creek to Fitzroy River estuary system in Victoria) with the others remaining in freshwater. Nocturnal movement was mostly detected, with migration to the estuary occurring year-round but increasing in Southern hemisphere summer months and during high flows. Seaward migration was found to occur from late summer to early autumn, and was influenced primarily by lunar phase, and more weakly correlated with water temperature. Todd (1981) also found lunar phase and increased flow to influence seaward migration in <em>A. australis</em>. </p><p>      </p><p><em>A. australis</em> is assumed to be panmictic, with the genetic structure indicating derivation from a single population (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012; Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although, it has been questioned whether there are exists two sub-populations — <em>A. australis australis </em>in Australia and <em>A. australis schmidtii </em>in New Zealand — that are reproductively isolated with separate spawning locations (Ege 1939, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2008). Like all anguillids, <em>A. australis</em> is believed to be semelparous, spawning only once before death (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). The exact spawning location is currently unknown. It has been proposed to occur either to the west of New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (Pease 2004, Gomon and Bray 2018), between Fiji and Tahiti (Castle 1963, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tesch 2003 in Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) or northeast of Samoa (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001). Spawning location is generally thought to exist within the South Equatorial Current (SEC), after which leptocephali, are likely to be transported in the SEC westward flow to the East Australian Current (EAC) (Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). The EAC transports larvae south to their recruitment areas whilst eastward flow across the Tasman Front would transport other individuals to New Zealand (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is thought that the average larval life for <em>A. australis</em> is six months (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although it has also been proposed leptocephali take 9–10 months to reach New Zealand, in late winter to early summer (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008). In a comprehensive review of data, average larval transport duration was found to be 7–8 months (Jellyman and Briand 2016). The mean size of glass eels of <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">A. australis </em>when they recruit to the New Zealand coast is 59.3 mm (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2004). On reaching estuaries and river mouths, larvae have metamorphosed into glass eels, with subsequent upstream migration of pigmented elvers (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Environmental variables have been shown to affect <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>glass eel migrations. In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, New Zealand glass eels displayed a preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C for migration, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to suppress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). In the Waikato River, North Island, New Zealand, glass eel recruitment was studied (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Glass eel migrations were found to be positively correlated with spring tides, particularly at the peak of high tide (Jellyman<em> et al.</em> 2009). Water temperature and discharge were also shown to significantly affect glass eel catch (Jellyman<em> et al. </em>2009).</p><p><em>Note: Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk531771015""><em>Anguilla australis</em></a>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to;&#160;barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood <a name=""_Hlk4165200"">(Jacoby <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015)</a>. It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel numbers. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits&#160;arguably increase the impact of&#160;threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. In comparison to the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>,<em> </em>there is less concern surrounding the status of <em>A. australis</em>, primarily due to its life history; faster growth, and earlier age at seaward migration (PCE 2013). As well as this, the geographic range of <em>A. australis</em> is much larger than that of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em><em> </em>(PCE 2013). Currently, habitat degradation, particularly wetland loss, fragmentation, and effects of drought, are plausibly the most prominent threats to this species (Jellyman 2009).</p><p><em>A. australis</em> is the target of fisheries across its geographic range in both Australia and New Zealand, where it is the primary eel landed in Victoria (2017: 84%) (VFA 2017), Tasmania (2009: ~98.5%) (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009), and New Zealand (2015–16: 81%) (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In Victoria, catch is of elvers for on-growing in stock enhanced culture lakes, and silver eels (“migrating adult eels”) (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). In Tasmania, focus is on yellow eels with some silver eels, commercial catch of glass eels is illegal except for research or stocking purposes (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009). In New Zealand, catch of glass eels is illegal, and therefore catch reports are of yellow and silver eels only, although minimum and maximum weight limits of 220 g and 4 kg, respectively, are currently in place to prevent catch of migrating silver eels (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Due to this, <em>A. australis</em> catch is of yellow females, as male migration occurs before reaching the minimum size, potentially creating a skewed sex ratio in escaping silver eels (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), with the exception of Te Waihora where migratory males under 220 g are also harvested (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). A study by Chisnall (1994) investigated the effects of fishing pressure in the Ahirau stream, an unexploited pastoral stream in Waikato, containing both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. In the unexploited stream, prior to the removal of marketable sized eels, the dominant biomass was large <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, which were found largely within pools. <em>A. australis</em> mainly inhabited shallower, faster flowing areas and were found in greater numbers, although in much smaller sizes, possibly due to territorial behaviour by <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> excluding <em>A. australis</em> from pools (Chisnall 1994). After the initial removal of eels, it was found that <em>A. australis</em> had a greater abundance and penetrated further upstream, and very few <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were caught, including few elvers, showing little recovery and possibly poor recruitment (Chisnall 1994). It was concluded that commercial fishing pressure represents more of a threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> than to <em>A. australis</em>, due to their ease of capture (Chisnall 1994). <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> may have previously dominated eel populations within the Waikato prior to exploitation, which has seemingly reduced the density and biomass of this species (Chisnall 1994). <a name=""_Hlk534971999"">However, in the sites where <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were recruited, interspecific competition favoured <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, and the density and biomass of <em>A. australis</em> was reduced (Chisnall 1994).</a><a name=""_Hlk531769381""></a> <a name=""_Hlk531772049""></a>This study supports the hypothesis that the extent of <em>A. australis</em> found upstream is more a matter of suitable, available, or accessible habitat rather than migration ability (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk531772990"">Habitat degradation poses a threat to <em>A. australis</em> in New Zealand. Since European settlement began in 1840, felling of trees for timber has occurred, along with burning of forests for quick conversion to pasture faming (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). By the 1980s, around 70% of the native forest had been lost (PCE 2013). Topsoil run-off as a result of forest clearing resulted in large scale erosion and sedimentation of rivers, detrimental effects of which are still being seen in the present day (PCE 2013). Although the effects of this are more detrimental to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>—<em> </em>as <em>A. australis</em> prefers soft bottom muddy waters — the reduction of riparian zone compromises the overall health of the river system (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Widespread habitat loss through channel straightening and wetland drainage is a serious problem for <em>A. australis</em>, due to their preferences for lower reaches, coastal areas and estuaries (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005; Jellyman 2009, 2012; PCE 2013). Where wetland drainage still occurs, and where flood pumping stations control water levels, eels can be sucked into pump intakes if they are unscreened (PCE 2013, Vaipuhi Consulting 2017). Impellors spin within the pumps, resulting in 100% mortality to eels greater than 600 mm in length, mostly migrating females; for smaller eels of a size less than 600 mm, it is significantly lower, at 12% (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Impacts of flood pumps may be greater for <em>A. australis</em>, as they are more prevalent in low land areas. </a>The effects of farming irrigation have also been suggested to be detrimental to eels in New Zealand. Poor water quality resulting from greater concentrations of nutrients and sediment in the water has been linked to excessive plant growth and smothering of the stream bed, reducing habitat and food for eels (PCE 2013). The use of drainage for pastoral purposes means there is a requirement for drain cleaning (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). This is most common in low-lying lands and is therefore a threat to <em>A. australis </em>(Jellyman 2012). Methods include both mechanical clearing and herbicides, and personal accounts have reported that mechanical excavation leads to eels being scooped out of the water onto banks, causing direct mortality if they cannot make it back to the watercourse (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). &#160;</p><p>In Australia, poor water management and excessive surface and ground water use has caused river flow reduction, causing consequent negative impacts to biodiversity, increased soil salinity, and contaminant accumulation (Jellyman 2016). In the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, there have been multiple disturbances since European settlement, including clearing 37% of the catchment for land use, abstraction, pollution from run-off and sewage, and mining (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p><p>In Victoria, recurrent drought conditions from 1994 to 2007, have caused declines in the production of both stock-enhanced and wild <em>A. australis </em>(McKinnon 2002)<em>. </em>The wild component of this fishery is based on silver eels (“migrating adult eels”), and during drought periods, when the stock enhanced productivity is low, reliance on the wild component increases (McKinnon 2002). In September 2006, Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) testing was conducted on Lake Martin in Victoria, where it was found that salinity was 25% higher than seawater, and the maximum depth of the lake was 50 cm, as a result of drought (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In another four monitored rivers between spring 2006 and autumn 2007, eel deaths were also related to high salinity and pH conditions (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). In Lake Modewarre, Lake Tooliorook and Lake Bolac, a pH of 9–9.5 and a rise in salinity by 20% per month was a common factor leading to eel deaths (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Drought can also affect eels through increased nutrient input and accumulation resulting in algal blooms and subsequent eutrophication (McKinnon 2002). In southeastern Australia, climate change is projected to result in reduced rainfall, in the order of 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), resulting in reduced streamflow and declining area of freshwater habitat in coastal catchments. Therefore, it seems likely that such lakes will no longer be habitable for eels, resulting in marked reductions in their distribution in mainland Australia.</p><p>The development of hydropower and dams/weirs in New Zealand is also a threat to eels, impeding upstream and downstream migration, and reducing the amount of suitable available habitat (Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boubée <em>et al.</em> 2008, Graynoth <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jellyman 2012). Although <em>A. australis</em> has been found not to travel as far inland as <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, this may still pose a threat to migration (Jellyman 2012). Even with programmes such as trap and transfer, females predominantly reside further upstream, and the inability to complete seaward migration can cause skewed sex ratios during spawning (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005). During downstream migration, mortality of larger eels in hydroelectric turbines can be up to 100%, dependent on turbine speed and type (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Upstream migration of glass eels can also be affected by barriers, and even with the addition of fishways to allow safe passage, the high velocity of flows out of the fishway may restrict glass eel migration (Langdon and Collins 2000). <a name=""_Hlk532459631"">In Australia, dams also pose a threat to eels. An example is Tallowa Dam, found in the Shoalhaven River, in New South Wales. Sampling of fish species at the dam found <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii</em> living immediately below (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). Unlike many other species, <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii</em> were able to pass over the dam, by climbing the spillway wall (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). Despite their ability to climb the wall, the large accumulations of these two species occurring at the base of the dam highlights the effect of barriers on slowing migration, as well as associated density dependent effects; increased risk of predation, potential for over-exploitation through fishing, and increased risk of mortality as a result of disease epidemics occurring in confined habitats (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). </a>Since this time, a high-level fish lift commenced operation on Tallowa Dam in 2009 to reinstate fish passage. By 2014, <em>A. australis</em> were only using the fishway infrequently, compared to <em>A. reinhardtii</em> which passed through the fishway in much larger numbers (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a single individual of <em>A. australis</em> was caught upstream after commissioning the fishway, compared to 185 <em>A. reinhardtii</em>. No <em>A. australis</em> were caught immediately below the dam suggesting that <em>A. australis</em> remains a relatively uncommon species in the Shoalhaven River system (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em></em></p><p>            </p><p>Changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions have been implicated in the decline in recruitment seen in all temperate anguillid species (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). For some species, this involves El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which have potentially been affecting spawning and recruitment of <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009)<em>. </em>Alterations in surface layer characteristics (productivity/community structure) may also have occurred due to ocean warming, affecting both larval feeding and transport (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, New Zealand, glass eels (both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) migrating upstream were found to display preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to supress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). It was therefore implied that warmer waters occurring as a result of the changing climate may be detrimental to glass eel recruitment in the native range of these species (August and Hicks 2008). In the North Island Waikato River, glass eel recruitment (both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) was also studied over a period of two years (2004–05) (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Comparison of catch results from this study with previous catch data (30 years apart), found glass eel migration periods to occur earlier in the present study, by several weeks (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). It was also found that reduced CPUE and duration of runs in the recent sampling, indicating a reduction in recruitment may also have occurred (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). One possible explanation given, was that deviations were a result of climate change, as although no consistent national trend exists, fresh water temperatures in New Zealand have increased by ~1.6°C from 1989-2005 (Scarsbrook 2006 in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). <a name=""_Hlk531353491"">Glass eels sampled by Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2009) were caught between temperatures of 12.6</a>°C and 13.1°C, substantially below the 16.5°C optimum suggested by August and Hicks (2008). There was also evidence that glass eels may compensate for increased temperature through earlier seasonal migration (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Therefore, if they were to wait for river temperatures &gt;12°C before beginning upstream migration, the time window would become limited (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). For these studies, catches in both the Tukituki and Waikato were both predominantly <em>A. australis</em>, 91–93% and &gt;97%, respectively (August and Hicks 2008, Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a>In&#160;</a>New Zealand, there is less concern over the population of <em>A. australis</em> than the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015)<em>. </em>The most recent data available from New Zealand is from the Fisheries New Zealand Fisheries Assessment Plenary, published in May 2018. This document is a summary of fisheries, biological, environmental, stock assessment, and stock status information for commercial fish species in New Zealand. The first available catch data (landings, tonnes (t)) of yellow, and to a lesser extent, silver eels, is from 1965, although up to 1989–90 this encompassed landings of both shortfin <em>(A. australis)</em> and longfin (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>), with the latter making up ~25% of commercial eel catch (PCE 2013). Although not a legislative requirement, there are no targeted fisheries for silver eels - with the exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora) in New Zealand (Jellyman 2007). This is due to capture being difficult at high flow periods when most migrate, and voluntary bans among fishers to support the sustainability of the stock (Jellyman 2007). Australasian longfin (<em>A. reinhardtii</em>), after identification in 1996 (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 1996), has been confirmed in North Island landings, although the percentage is unknown and thought to contribute very little, so is included and managed within ‘shortfin’ (<em>A. australis</em>) stocks. Catch data prior to 1988 was also collected by calendar year not fishing season, which straddle years. Fisheries New Zealand (2018) reports landings (t) of both ‘shortfin’ and ‘longfin’ from 1989–90 to 2015–16. In 1989–90, landings of ‘shortfin’ eels totalled 617 t, in 2015–16 this decreased to 378 t, a decline of ~39%. However, the effects of market demand, quotas, voluntary non-targeting, and fishery closures (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017), mean it would not be accurate to infer population declines solely from the landings data presented within the Fisheries Assessment Plenary.</p><p>Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data is available for New Zealand by Eel Statistical Area (ESA), a list of which can be found in Fisheries New Zealand (2018). For North Island ESAs — not including Wellington (ESA AM), due to lack of data — from 1990–91 to 2014–15, CPUE for ‘shortfin’ (<em>A.australis</em> with small proportion of <em>A. reinhardtii</em>) showed either declines or no trend up to 2002, after which it increased (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). For Northland (ESA AA), CPUE did not show the declines, and exhibited a steady increase throughout the series (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). Increased CPUE is suggested to have occurred as a result of the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) reductions in 2007–08 as well as voluntary reductions in Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) by iwi&#160;—&#160;the political unit of the Māori representing customary and commercial interests&#160;—&#160;prior to this. Estimates of CPUE are described as being conservative following 2007 due to non-reporting of legal sized eels returned to the water, a consequence of fishers not having enough ACE to cover the catch, but also voluntarily forgoing opportunities to fulfil their ACE (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). The increased size of fyke net escape tubes — a <a name=""_Hlk3295968"">mechanism to allow eels under the size restriction to escape —</a> from 25 mm to 31 mm in 2013–14 to exclude eels &lt;300 g will also have contributed to these conservative estimates (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017).</p><p>Analysis of CPUE has also been conducted for South Island ESAs from 1990–91 to 2012–13 (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). In data poor areas (Nelson (ESA AN), Marlborough, South Marlborough (ESAs AP-AQ), North and South Canterbury (ESA AR, AT), and Waitaki (ESA AU)) prior to the Quota Management System (QMS), there were indications of a declining trend between 1991–2000, most prominently in Marlborough and South Marlborough (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). For areas in which there was more data (Westland (ESA AX), Otago (ESA AV), Southland (ESA AW) and Te Waihora (AS1)), CPUE showed initial declines in Otago and Southland prior to the QMS, and in Westland this decline was followed by an increase (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). After the introduction of the QMS in 2000, there was an increase in CPUE for all ESAs, but this was most prominent in Southland and Te Waihora (Beentjes and Dunn 2013).</p><p>Records from 1977–2015 collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) were analysed by Crow <em>et al</em>. (2016) using a generalised linear model, to estimate the probability of capture as an index of relative abundance for each year of record. Two analyses were carried out, one using probability of capture values only, and one that was weighted,&#160;through placing higher emphasis on observations for which there is greater confidence.&#160;Within all analyses, both weighted and unweighted, across the whole time series, and only using data from 1995–2015, occurrence of <em>A. australis</em> increased. The data within NZFFD records are collected country-wide, possibly suggesting country-wide trends, however, records were mostly from electrofishing which may over-represent life stages in stream habitats accessible to this method (Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>In Australia, Victoria is the main area for fishing <em>A. australis</em>. The Victorian Eel Fishery uses both wild caught and stock enhanced commercial catch, whereby eel production through stock enhancement involves catch of elvers and on-growing in ‘culture’ lakes under natural conditions (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). This method comprises 40% of the commercial catch, the rest being wild catch of silver eels (“migrating adult eels”) (McKinnon 2002).&#160;Fishery data from 1978–2016 is reported as annual catch with no metric of effort and consists of both wild caught and stock enhanced eels (yellow/silver) (VFA 2017). <em>A. australis</em> represents 84% of catch over the period 1978–2016, with the other 16% consisting of <em>A. reinhardtii</em> (VFA 2017). Catch generally increased from 1978 to 1993, after which declines observed in western regions during the late 1990s, and early 2000s were attributed to the “Millennium Drought” affecting fishery viability, particularly of ‘culture’ waters but also wild caught stocks (VFA 2017). In Tasmania, the eel fishery reports catch of yellow and silver eels, largely focussing on <em>A. australis</em>. Fishing effort data is collected although has “not yet been analysed and reported” (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). Activity is closely linked to the market and so fishers will not fish if prices are too low to attain commercial benefit, and fishing effort is also affected by drought, with expected higher CPUE occurring when drought conditions concentrate eels, creating more efficient fishing (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). The Queensland Eel Fishery combines catch of yellow and silver (&gt;30 cm) <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii, </em>although primarily <em>A. reinhardtii</em> (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012)<em>. </em>CPUE for this fishery showed a steep decline from just under 160 kg/day in 2004, to around 30 kg/day in 2007. From 2007–2012, CPUE has remained constant at just over 30 kg/day. Since 2012, CPUE has increased up to ~40 kg/day in 2017, 2016 was an exception to this, with only 25 kg/day (Daf.qld.gov.au 2018). Harvest of yellow and silver eels in the Queensland Eel Fishery is from “artificial impoundments” where juvenile eels have been stocked for grow-out purposes, CPUE is therefore stated to be “not representative of wild adult eel stocks” (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). Stock status for this fishery is described as “sustainably fished” (owing to “strict conditions related to permitted fishing areas”) (Queensland Government 2010, Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). In New South Wales, catch of eels is primarily (90%) <em>A. reinhardtii</em>, with reports of landings combining this with <em>A. australis </em>(Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indices of CPUE are calculated for this fishery, which remained stable from 1997–98 to 2008–09 before a slight increase from 2008–09 to 2011–12 and subsequent decline to 2013–14 (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2015). Whilst some reports describe <em>A. australis</em> as being abundant in New South Wales coastal rivers (Beumer 1996), intensive quantitative surveys found this species to be relatively uncommon in the southern coastal region, with only a single individual caught in the northern coastal region (Harris and Gehrke 1997). </p><p>Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2009) provided the first strong indication that recruitment of <em>A. australis</em> glass eels had declined in the Waikato River in New Zealand. When comparing sampling of <em>Anguilla </em>spp<em>.</em> (both <em>A. australis</em> (97%) and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (3%)) during 2004–05 to previous sampling in the 1970s, CPUE (kg / net h) had declined by ~66% over ~30 years, from 5.80 ± 1.25 in the 1970s, to 1.99 ± 0.96 in 2004–05. However, conclusions based on two years' data must be provisional, as interannual variation in recruitment can be 10-fold (Francis and Jellyman 1999, in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). As part of a Public Good Science Fund (PGSF) research programme on eels, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand conducted regular sampling for glass eels (Jellyman 2012). The data series ran from 1995 to 2006, and analysis was conducted on glass eel catches sampled at two weekly intervals during September and October (Jellyman 2012). The analysis found <em>A. australis</em> glass eel density increased over the sampling period, and also was greater than that of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em><em>, </em>(Jellyman 2012). However, the time period assessed in this paper is relatively short in comparison to generation length (20 years), and other studies (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009) have found evidence of recruitment declines (Jellyman 2012). Since 1995, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been monitoring recruitment through elver trap and transfer operations at hydro dams. Martin and Bowman (2016), estimated recruitment trends between 1995 and 2015, using the data collected from six locations: Wairua Falls Power Station, Karapiro Dam, Matahina Dam, Patea Dam, Waitaki Dam and Arnold Dam. Trends in catch indices are largely variable, although in Karapiro and Matahina, for both <em>A. dieffenbachi</em> and <em>A. australis</em>, catch peaked between 2007 and 2009, underwent a sharp decline in 2011–12, before again increasing in 2014–15. In the South Island, there were large gaps in data, making it difficult to discern trends. Arnold Dam showed declines from 2007–08, although increased in 2014–15. When investigating size distribution of eels, Jellyman (2012) found a healthy distribution for <em>A. australis</em> consisting of a larger proportion of small eels (50–99 mm, 100–149 mm) being present, compared to larger eels. </p><p>Wetland drainage has resulted in a huge loss of habitat for <em>A. australis </em>in New Zealand (Jellyman 2016). Since European settlement in the 1840s, to the mid-1970s, lowland wetlands have been progressively drained, resulting in a reduction from around 670,000 ha to 100,000 ha (85%) (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). The wetland areas that remain have been subject to other stressors, such as pollution, animal grazing and introduced plants (Taylor and Smith 1997). Droughts occurring in Victoria have also been linked to declines in both wild-caught and stock-enhanced <em>A. australis </em>(McKinnon 2002). Western region declines in catch from 1990–2000 were attributed to the drought conditions reducing areas of harvest, particularly in stock enhanced culture waters (VFA 2017). Although, with no metric of effort within this series, it is difficult to validate this. In 1999, in Lake Gnarpurt, western Victoria, an algal bloom resulting from drought conditions killed an estimated 100 t of eels (McKinnon 2002). In the summers of 2004–05 and 2005–06, there were records of severe cases of eel deaths in the Western District of Victoria (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In 2004–05, ten waterways recorded eel deaths, although fewer than 100 eels each time. In January of 2005, there was 5000 recorded dead eels in Lake Modewarre. A repeat event occurred in January and February 2006, with 20 t — estimated to be 50,000 individuals — of dead eels recorded, and there is now said to be “doubts amongst commercial fishers whether there are any eels surviving in this lake, let alone commercially viable quantities” (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In Lake Bolac, another large eel death event was recorded in January 2006 of 5000 eels, and in February 2006 more than 200 dead eels were observed on the shore of Lake Martin (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). A monitoring programme running from spring 2006 to autumn 2007 was conducted in four lakes (Lake Modewarre, Lake Colac, Lake Tooliorook, and Lake Bolac), of these, two large eel deaths occurred in lakes that support commercial eel fishing (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). From late November to early December 2006, it was estimated that in Lake Tooliorook, 75,000 eels died, and in Lake Bolac, the largest of the deaths, an estimated 95,000 eels, was recorded in March 2007 (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Following these events, it was considered unlikely that any eels remained within these two lakes by the end of autumn 2007 (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Eels were believed to remain in Lake Colac, thought to be the last large inland lake eel population, the retention of which was dependent on future drought conditions (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Eel deaths occurring in the western lakes were mostly comprised of large females said to be in “good condition” (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). <em>A. reinhardtii</em> may also comprise some of the biomass in these events, although this species isn’t as common in Victoria as <em>A. australis&#160;</em>(VFA 2017). Drought has continued in Victoria, and although re-stocking took place in 2016, this was of mostly rainbow and brown trout (Tagried Kurwie pers. comm. 2019). In southeastern Australia, climate change is projected to result in reduced rainfall, in the order of 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), resulting in reduced streamflow and declining area of freshwater habitat in coastal catchments. Therefore, it seems likely that such lakes will no longer be habitable for eels, resulting in marked reductions in their distribution in mainland Australia.</p><p>Under the New Zealand Threat Classification Series,<em> A. australis </em>has been assessed as ‘Not Threatened’ (species with large stable populations), with qualifier ‘Inc’ for increasing (Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2018). The New Zealand Threat Classification Series defines population as “The total number of individuals that are resident or that breed in New Zealand” referring solely to mature individuals (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). For a ‘Not Threatened’ taxon, there must be 20,000–100,000 or &gt;100,000 mature individuals, and the population trend must be stable (±10%) or increasing (&gt;10%) (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). The qualifier ‘Inc’ refers to an ongoing or predicted increase of &gt;10% in the total population taken over the next 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is longer (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). The difficulty with assessing an anguillid species using this terminology, as with the IUCN classification, is that there is no direct metric for ‘mature individuals’, as eels are not considered mature until they reach breeding grounds to spawn. Therefore, it is necessary to assess them using a suitable alternative metric (for example, silver eel escapement/glass eel recruitment). Within the New Zealand Threat Classification Series assessment, there is no indication as to what metric was used or reasoning as to why that metric was decided to be an appropriate alternative.</p>      <p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Anguilla australis</em>, is a temperate eel (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004) found in New Zealand, eastern Australia, Tasmania, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia (Ege 1939) and the Chatham islands (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is most abundant in latitudes 35–44<sup>o</sup>S, although is distributed 20–54<sup>o</sup>S (Beumer and Sloane 1990, Shiao <em>et al</em>. 2002). <em>A. australis</em> mostly inhabits lowlands, dominating lakes, estuaries, low river reaches and wetlands (Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). Upper altitudes occur at around 250 m southwest of the North Island of New Zealand around Mt. Ruapehu, with occasional records higher (&gt;400–500 m) (GBIF 2018). In the Southern coastal region of New South Wales, <em>A. australis</em> is a characteristic species of montane rivers at elevations above 700 m (Gehrke and Harris 2000). The precise spawning location for <em>A. australis</em> is unknown, although it is thought to occur to the west of New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (Pease 2004, Gomon and Bray 2018), it has also been proposed to lie between Fiji and Tahiti (Castle 1963, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tesch 2003 in Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) or northeast of Samoa (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001). It is assumed that this species is panmictic, utilising a single spawning ground (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012; Fisheries New Zealand, 2018), although it has been questioned whether there are two sub-populations with separate spawning areas (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><sup></sup>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from juvenile to adult, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 t), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is&#160;<em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other&#160;<em>Anguilla</em>&#160;spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018). Catch or export of glass eels from New Zealand is not permitted (apart from small quantities for research purposes), and where catch of juvenile eels is permitted in Australia, they may not be exported and can only be sold to aquaculture operations within Australia, of which there are currently very few. However, based on East Asian Customs data, Hong Kong reported imports of 1761 kg of live eel fry from Australia in 2014–2015 and Korea 180 kg in 2015–2016, suggesting there may be some illegal trade/demand for either&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>or&#160;<em>A. reinhardtii&#160;</em>juvenile eels, despite there being no information that these species are currently used in eel farms in East Asia (Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter (52% and 71% of global exports by weight and value respectively during 2006–2015) and Japan the main importer (for 54% and 72%). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;Trade in&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>on the other hand is predominantly in wild or stocked eels.</p><p>In New Zealand, eels <a name=""_Hlk3450730"">(known in Te Reo as “tuna”) </a>feature extensively in <a name=""_Hlk3450666"">Māori</a> mythology and large eels are considered spiritual guardians of waterways. &#160;<a name=""_Hlk3450748"">To this day, eels are important to Māori for cultural reasons. In some cases, they are considered a delicacy and are served at various functions. </a>Prior to European settlement, Māori already had extensive knowledge of the ecology of eels and developed effective fisheries through combinations of traps, spearing, bait fishing and large weirs (McDowall 1990, 2011; Jellyman, 2012). The extent of current or past non-commercial take in New Zealand is unknown, however current allowances for customary and recreational take of shortfin eels (<em>A. australis</em>) <a name=""_Hlk3450790"">as of 2018 were set at: 15.2% of TAC (74 t) in the North Island, and 19.9% of TAC (65 t) in South Island, for customary take. For recreational take, allowances were 13% of TAC (63 t) in the North island, and 2.9% of TAC (9.4 t) in the South Island (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>).</a> </p><p>Large scale commercial yellow and silver eel fisheries of domestic species began in New Zealand in the 1960s with the arrival of Dutch immigrants to New Zealand, who had both the knowledge of eel fisheries and the ability to make and use fyke nets (McDowall 1990). The fishery grew rapidly until annual catches of 2000 t were recorded in the early 1970s. Annual landings were relatively stable from 1983 to 2001 (~1000–1500 t), after which they dropped as eel stocks were progressively introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS), TACCs were reduced and international demand declined (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Over the last decade, total commercial annual catch has ranged between about 450–750 t.&#160;<em>A.&#160;australis</em>&#160;catch has accounted for around 70–80% of this: ranging between ~370 and 520 t a year (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the early 1990s, there were 23 licensed eel processing factories operating in New Zealand,&#160;in 2012 there were only 4 or 5 remaining (Jellyman 2012).&#160;</p><p>The majority of New Zealand eel catch (&gt;70%) is exported, with the main domestic consumption being by Māori customary fishers (<a name=""_Hlk3821292"">New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries</a> 2018).&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;eels between 500 g and 1 kg are often exported live; according to industry sources, this is to ensure freshness, and to sell in markets and restaurants that specialise in providing live fish in tanks for selection by customers (New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries 2018). According to New Zealand Customs data (which does not differentiate between eel species), New Zealand exported 3,636 t of frozen eels and 2,818 t of live eels during 2008–2017. Annual frozen eel exports ranged between 152 and 380 t during 2008–2017 except for 2010 when these exceeded 1,189 t with sudden increases in frozen eel exports to South Korea (926 t). Except in 2010, the main destinations of frozen eels were Belgium, the UK and Germany. Live eel exports reached a peak of 517 t in 2011, after which they declined gradually to 133 t in 2016. The main destinations of live eels were South Korea until 2013, mainland China (2014–2016) and Canada in 2017. Jellyman (2012) reported that there has been a substantial increase in the price that New Zealand eels are fetching on overseas markets, although details are scarce.</p><p>Freshwater eels have a long history as a food source throughout their range in eastern Australia, firstly as part of the subsistence diet of aboriginal people (for whom eels also have a strong cultural significance) and then as a commercial fishery developed by European settlers since the early 1900s (Pease 2004). Due to its more temperate distribution,&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;dominates&#160;commercial catches in Victoria and Tasmania (McKinnon 2002, DEPI 2013). Take by recreational and indigenous fisheries is expected to be low: a Queensland state-wide recreational fishing survey undertaken in 2010 indicated that recreational take of eels was approximately 2000 adult eels per year. Australia started reporting eel farming production to FAO in 1984. After reaching peaks of 315 t in 1997 and 1998, farming production has steadily declined, and none has been reported since 2012 (FAO 2018).</p><p><br/> In Victoria,&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>is the most abundant and predominately fished eel species, making up approximately 80% of the total annual catch of eels in Australia (Baker 2010). The first commercial catches of eels in Victoria were recorded in 1914 and until the 1950s the commercial eel fishery was based on supplying bait to the rock lobster and long-line shark fisheries (export of<em>&#160;A. australis</em>&#160;to Europe commenced only in the early 1960s). Four of the life stages (glass eels, elvers, yellow eels and silver eels) are commercially utilized in Victoria, but a major component of the Victorian commercial eel fishery consists of adult eels at various stages of migration (Baker 2010). Yellow and silver eels are commercially fished for domestic and export markets and glass eels and elvers are used for stock enhancement and aquaculture (Baker 2010). Catch of glass eels has been found to have been of “limited success due to the highly variable abundance in Victoria” and currently there is no on-growing occurring in intensive aquaculture facilities in the state (VFA 2017).</p><p>In Tasmania,&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;makes up ~98.5% of the catch (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009). The commercial fishery in Tasmania is based on the harvest of eels larger than 300 mm in length. Fishing activity in Tasmania has been shown to be heavily influenced by eel price and market demand: eel fishers will cease or reduce fishing effort if eel prices are too low prohibited (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009).&#160;Interest in eel culture has led to periodic aquaculture trials but has not progressed into commercial development. Other glass eel catch is carried out for research or stocking purposes at sites where barriers impede natural migration, but commercial fishing of glass eels is prohibited (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009).&#160;</p><p>Fishing for&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;also occurs in Queensland and New South Wales, although is not the main focus of these fisheries.&#160;<em>A. australis </em>makes up around 10% of the catch in the New South Wales Estuary General Fishery (Pease 2004). Aquaculture of eels also exists in New South Wales, although production is small, and a precautionary approach is being taken with respect to glass eel harvest (Dpi.nsw.gov.au 2018<em>b</em>).</p><p>                    </p><p>There is a limited domestic market for eels in Australia,&#160;and most is exported to Asia (live) and Europe (frozen) (<a name=""_Hlk3821400"">Australian Department of the Environment and Energy 2018</a>). According to UN Comtrade, Australia exported 2,635 t of eel commodities (all species) during 2007–2016, 91% of which were live eel exports. Live eel exports reached a peak of ~370 t in 2012, after which they gradually decreased to 96 t in 2016. Hong Kong was the dominant destination of live eels from Australia, accounting for 84% of live eel exports from the country between 2007 and 2016.<strong></strong></p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>There has been previous debate over the taxonomic status of <em>A. australis</em>, with some suggesting the possibility of two sub-species. This debate has led to questions over whether there should be separate management for each sub-species (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012). Jellyman (2007), stated that they are found to show genetic homogeneity at the glass eel stage, and should therefore be managed cooperatively by Australia and New Zealand as if it were a single population. Currently, management of <em>A. australis</em> is independent across Australian states and New Zealand.</p><p>In Australia, fisheries target both the shortfin eel (<em>Anguilla australis</em>) and the Australian longfin eel (<em>Anguilla reinhardtii</em>). The Victorian Eel Fishery is managed in accordance with the&#160;<em>Fisheries Act 1995</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Fisheries Regulations 2009</em> (VFA 2018). The latest Victorian Eel Fishery Management Plan was published in 2017, which sets out management arrangements, objectives, strategies and actions of the fishery for the next five years (VFA 2017). Victoria does not operate closed seasons for the commercial harvest of eels (VFA 2017). The Tasmanian Eel Fishery is managed in accordance with the <em>Inland Fisheries Act 1995 </em>and<em> Inland Fisheries Regulations 1996</em> (Australian Government 2004). A management plan does not exist for this fishery, although the latest assessment was published in 2016 (Australian Government 2016). The fishery is managed through gear restrictions, geographically defined licencing, closed catchments and significant protection of glass eels/elvers and migrating silver eels (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). The Queensland Eel Fishery management regime falls under the <em>Fisheries Act 1994</em>, <em>Fisheries Regulation 2008</em>, <em>Policy for Management Arrangements for the Commercial Harvesting and use of Juvenile Eels</em> (The Juvenile Eel Policy), and <em>Integrated Planning Act 1997</em> (for juveniles harvested for aquaculture) (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). The Queensland fishing season runs from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December, and the latest assessment of the fishery under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em> was published in 2014 which includes a summary of issues and recommendations (Australian Government 2014). The eel fishery in Queensland is a closed fishery, with non-transferrable licences. For New South Wales, harvest of eels occurs as part of the Estuary General Fishery (multi-species), under the enforcement legislation: NSW <em>Fisheries Management (Estuary General Share Management Plan) Regulation 2006</em>, NSW <em>Fisheries Management Act 1994</em>, NSW <em>Fisheries Management (General) Regulation 2010</em>, and NSW <em>Fisheries Management (Supporting Plan) Regulation 2006 </em>(Australian Government 2018, Dpi.nsw.gov.au. 2018<em>a</em>)<em>. </em>An assessment for this fishery under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em> (EBPC act) was conducted in 2018, depicting where the fishery meets or does not meet the guidelines set out by the EPBC act (Australian Government 2018).</p><p>Fishways are used in Australia to mitigate the impact of obstructions to fish passage (Jones and O’Connor 2017). The <em>Victorian Waterway Management Strategy </em>(VWMS) is a framework for waterway management, covering the maintenance and improvement of water conditions (DEPI 2013, Jones and O’Connor 2017). &#160;Policies within this framework look at improving connectivity, and therefore relate to eel passage (Jones and O’Connor 2017). New South Wales manages fish passage under the <em>NSW</em> <em>Fisheries Management Act 1994</em>, whereby all new structures must consider fish passage, and the restoration of old structures that require a method of fish passage occurs (Thorncraft and Harris 2000). Concerns over a growing urban population in Sydney, and the construction of dams in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment to supply water to the Sydney metropolitan area, led to the enactment of the <em>Water Board Corporatisation Act 1994</em>, that required the Sydney Water Corporation to protect the aquatic environment through more sustainable practises, including the installation and commissioning of a high-level fishway on Tallowa Dam (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Tasmania, fish ladders have been installed to promote fish passage. An elver ladder was built at the Trevallyn Dam in 1996, although the ladder has now been de-commissioned, and other improvements made for passage of elvers (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). Hydro Tasmania reports it “is continuing to examine options to mitigate the impacts of dam and power generation infrastructure on spawning migrations of silver eels” (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). <a name=""_Hlk3304537"">West of New South Wales, on Tallowa Dam in Shoalhaven River, a high-level fish lift commenced operation in 2009 (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>By 2014, <em>A. australis</em> were only using the fishway infrequently, compared to <em>A. reinhardtii</em> which passed through the fishway in much larger numbers (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a single individual of <em>A. australis</em> was caught upstream after commissioning the fishway, compared to 185 <em>A. reinhardtii </em>(Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). </p><p>In New Zealand, there is an annual meeting of the Eel Working Group focusing on eel fisheries management. This involves the Ministry of Fisheries fishery managers, the iwi&#160;—&#160;political unit of the Māori representing customary and commercial interests&#160;—&#160;commercial fishers, processers, the Seafood Industry Council, the Department of Conservation and research providers (Jellyman 2012). The meetings involve discussions surrounding research priorities, reviewing research outcomes and reviewing the annual report on eels (Ministry of Fisheries assessment plenary) (Jellyman 2012).</p><p>The New Zealand fishing season for all eel stocks extends from 1<sup>st</sup> October to 30<sup>th</sup> September, apart from Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere, where since 2002 the season is 1<sup>st</sup> February to 31<sup>st</sup> January (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <a name=""_Hlk3450913"">A Quota Management System (QMS) was introduced to New Zealand in 1986, to control the amount of fish taken from each stock (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2019<em>a</em>). </a>On 1<sup>st</sup> October 2000, the South Island eel fishery was introduced to the QMS, combining ‘shortfins’ (<em>A. australis </em>with some <em>A</em>.<em> reinhardtii</em>) and ‘longfins’ (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) within six stocks. The Chatham Island fishery followed, introducing the QMS on the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2003, with one stock for ‘shortfins’ and one for ‘longfins’. The North Island fishery was introduced on the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2004, <a name=""_Hlk534986305"">with eight fish stocks, four for each ‘shortfins’ and ‘longfins’ </a>(Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On 1<sup>st</sup> October 2017 the South Island stocks were finally separated into ‘longfins’ and ‘shortfins’, to allow species specific management (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk3450942"">The QMS involves establishing Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (In 2018: 327.59 t South Island, 486 t North Island) for each fish stock, which is split into: Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) (In 2018: 77% of TAC (252.1 t) South Island, 69.3% of TAC (337 t) North Island),&#160; customary catch, recreational catch, and other sources of fishing related mortality (Jellyman 2007, 2012). New Zealand’s indigenous people, Māori, have been allocated 20% of commercial quota, with additional catch allocation for customary take (Jellyman 2007, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Quota shares generate a certain amount of Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE), which does not necessarily have to be fished by owners themselves and can be sold to other licensed fishers that may or may not own quota. The proportion of the TAC given as customary allowance is different for both North and South Islands and can vary in different years as a result of adjustments made after reviews. The current customary allowance for the North Island is 15.2% of the TAC (74 t) after cuts to the TAC/TACC were made on 1<sup>st</sup> October 2018, although this varies within each Quota Management Area (QMA) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>b</em>). In the South Island the customary allowance is 19.8% of TAC (65 t), with the proportion again varying by QMA (values for TAC, TACC, cust. allowance, and rec. allowance for each North and South Island QMA can be found: Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>).</a></p><p>Minimum and maximum commercial size limits (220 g from 1992 and 4 kg from 1995 for South Island and 2007 for North Island) are in place for anguillid eels throughout New Zealand (Jellyman 2012). <a name=""_Hlk3450982"">The minimum size limit effectively excludes male shortfins, and so the fishery targets female yellow eels (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). </a>In 2005, Mohaka, Motu and most of the Whanganui River catchments were closed to commercial fishing (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the Waikato-Tainui rohe region in 2014, bylaws were introduced to limit minimum harvest sizes to 300 g for ‘shortfins’ and 400 g for ‘longfins’, with an upper limit of 2 kg for both (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), to prevent the take of migratory females. There is now no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of seaward migrating <em>A. australis</em> males under 220 g from Te Waihora (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). There was also the addition of seasonal closures in some reaches as a result of the introduced bylaws (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Across New Zealand, there also exists a recreational daily bag limit of six eels, introduced in October 1994 (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <a name=""_Hlk3297509"">Commercial fishing in New Zealand is also banned in National Parks and Scenic Reserves, and often on the Crown Estate (managed by the Department of Conservation).</a> In April 2018, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Department of Conservation developed the “New Zealand fish passage guidelines: for structures up to 4 m” in partnership with the New Zealand Fish Passage Advisory Group (Doc.govt.nz 2018, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 2018). The document outlines recommended practice for the design of instream infrastructure to provide for general fish passage and sets foundations for improved fish passage management, making some reference to eels specifically (Doc.govt.nz 2018, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 2018). Other management measures have included enhancement of upstream waters with juvenile eels although where this takes place upstream of hydro dams, escapement still remains an issue; setting aside additional reserve areas to increase escapement of silver eels; and increased management involvement of Māori (Jellyman 2007). </p><p>              </p><p>Since 1982/3 assistance of upstream elver passage over hydro-dams has occurred in New Zealand, and ‘trap and transfer’ methods are used to help improve the state of eel populations above these structures (Boubée <em>et al.</em> 2008). Lake Manapouri in the Waiau River catchment operates the largest hydropower station in New Zealand (Jellyman and Unwin 2018). To provide safe downstream passage egress for silver eels, Meridian Energy Ltd. - the power company responsible for the Manapouri Lake Control structure - are required to operate a ‘trap and transfer’ and monitoring programme, whereby silver eels are caught in the lake and transferred downstream of the obstruction to allow access to the sea (Jellyman and Unwin 2018, Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2018). Methods allowing for downstream movement include netting eels in headraces, and opening spillway gates at critical times, such as at the Patea Dam in Taranaki, where spillway gates are opened for an hour after sunset following heavy rain when mature eels are likely to migrate (PCE 2013). Māori have also practised various forms of management, named “rāhui”, which has included imposing fishing bans on waterways for ceremonial or conservation reasons and seeding areas with small eels (Jellyman 2012).</p><p></p>",Australasian,NA,FALSE,FALSE,Global
