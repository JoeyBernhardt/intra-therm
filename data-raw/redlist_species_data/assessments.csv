This species has a large distribution across Canada and the USA, and is considered to be common and widespread. It also occurs within at least three national parks, one in the United States, and two in Canada. However, the threats to this species across its vast range are still unknown, so that more research should be carried out to define threatening processes. Due to its large distribution, this species does not qualify for a threatened status.","This species lives in lakes, ponds, streams, ditches and marshes (Taylor 2003).",There is no threat information available for this species.,"This species is widespread and common (J.

However, Cameron and Fankboner (1989)&#160;observed that the pelagic phase could be as long as 65 to 125 days just to reach the auricularia stage and another 2 days were necessary for the pentactula to develop. This suggests that the spawning stock may be quite far from where the larvae settle and grow (Muse 1998). Settlement was observed in dense mats of filamentous red algae, algae holdfast, under rocks or in crevices (Cameron and Fankboner 1989, DFO 2002). The recruitment is sporadic and a high natural mortality rate is suspected (Rogers-Bennett and Ono 2001, Bruckner 2006). Juvenile growth is slow, reaching 0.5 to 2cm after a year and 4 to 10cm after two years (DFO 2002). Sexual maturity is reached after 4 years (Cameron and Fankboner 1989, Lambert 1997).

Between 1971 and 1987, sea cucumbers were harvested by divers without any seasonal or spatial restrictions. In 1987, when depletion of sea cucumber populations became noticeable, the state established harvest districts and a restricted harvest season (ADFG 1990). Today, most of the harvesting is done by hand using SCUBA or hookah, with only limited trawl collections under experimental fishery permits. Collection by divers for personal use/consumption is subject to a daily limit of ten specimens (Bruckner 2005).</p>              <p>In the state of California, the fishery started in 1978 and focused on two species: this species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. parvimensis</span>. Both diving and targeted trawling are used for the capture, however trawls are restricted mainly to the south of the state and their use has declined over the past few years (Bruckner 2006).

Sea cucumbers are collected by SCUBA divers. The fishery was initially not subject to any regulation, and the number of divers increased rapidly when, in 1990, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game closed down the fishery to develop a management plan. In 1995â1996, 424 divers were issued permits in southeast Alaska and this number decreased to 235 in 2001â2002 and 174 in 2006â2007  (Hebert and Pritchett 2002).

Only nine divers requested a permit for the fishery in 1993 even though 44 permits had been made available, whereas 22 divers were recorded in 1994 (Bruckner 2006). The number of harvesters in Oregon after 1994 remained low: five in 1997, two in 1999, one in 2000, two in 2001 and two in 2003 (Bruckner 2005).&#160;</p>                                        <p>This species&#160;is the only species fished on the west coast of Canada, the fishery being centered on Vancouver Island in the Georgia and Johnstone Straits and in the Puget Sound.

In 1988, 124 divers where involved and 163 in 1990 (Muse 1998). The fishery in British Columbia expanded rapidly after 1980 with annual landings exceeding 1900 tonnes in 1988. Fishing was initially permitted in the South Coast areas only and the majority of landings were taken in the Strait of Georgia until 1987. The north coast was opened in 1986 with a total annual recommended catch of 500 tonnes, although fishing did not occur there until 1987. To date, landings of sea cucumbers have been recorded from all Canadian Pacific fisheries management areas, with the exception of the North and West Queen Charlotte Islands. The central and north coasts currently support about 80 percent of the fishery (DFO 2002).</p></span>","<p></p><p>    </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO 2002) indicates that early southern British Columbia harvesters targeted populations of this species in areas close to the harbour, where diving was easy and the resource abundant. Researchers and managers felt that only a small proportion of the stock was being harvested, and that many sea cucumbers were left untouched in these areas. The fishery therefore expanded to more remote northern areas, but remained targeted on very accessible locations. Still today, large areas of the coast have not been visited by the commercial sea cucumber fleet. Surveys conducted in various areas of the coast indicate that sea cucumber population densities vary considerably with habitat type. Density estimates from almost all surveys are significantly higher than the conservative estimate of 5.08 sea cucumbers per meter of shoreline. This species'&#160;populations extend below the safe diving depth of 20m where extensive harvesting cannot be conducted (DFO 2002). In British Columbia, the densities are estimated at less than 0.25ind*m<sup>â2</sup> (Bruckner 2006). The CPUE values supplied by Muse (1998) for this species in British Columbia are in kg per diver per hour: 372 in 1983, 347 in 1987 and 617 in 1992.</p><p> Woodby<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>(2000) investigated the depth distribution of this species in the vicinity of Sitka Sound, Alaska and found that sea cucumber densities were greatest in shallower waters with ca. 70 percent of the sea cucumbers observed above 15m. Average densities were 0.03ind*m<sup>â2</sup> in deeper water and 0.3ind*m<sup>â2</sup> at SCUBA diving depths. The deepest sea cucumber was observed at 87m. In Southeast Alaska, Zhou and Shirley (1996) used a submersible to measure densities which varied from 0 to 267ind*ha<sup>â1</sup>. The highest density recorded was 0.23ind*m<sup>â2</sup>. Bruckner (2006) reported that harvested sites in California showed densities that were 50â80% lower than in the non-fished areas. For instance, at an established reserve in northern California, densities averaged 2200ind*ha<sup>â1</sup>. Another set of data from a newly established reserve (Punta Gorda Ecological Reserve) ranged from 250 to 790ind*ha<sup>â1</sup>, taking into account the large size classes of sea cucumbers exclusively (Rogers-Bennett and Ono 2001, Bruckner 2006). Until 1996, an average of 75 percent of the annual catch came from the trawl fishery in southern California. Between 1997 and 1999, the dive fishery accounted for 80 percent of the take. Recent surveys showed a 50â60 percent decline in abundance between 1994 and 1998, but no correlation was noted between decline in abundance and data on landings. The only increase in abundance (39 percent) was noted at two no-take reserves (Rogers-Bennett and Ono 2001; Schroeter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001). In California, between 1983 and 1990 annual landings fluctuated between  about 20,000 and 60,000kg. In 1991, over 261,871kg were harvested.  Combined trawl and dive harvest peaked in 1996 at 380,703kg with an  ex-vessel value of USD 582,370 (Rogers-Bennett and Ono 2001).</p><p> In Washington State, CPUE from 1983 show that the minimum in those days was around 75kg*diver<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>â1</sup> and the maximum around 130kg*diver<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>â1</sup> (Bradbury 1994). Data recorded in this state at the time clearly demonstrates the impact of the fishery on the stock of sea cucumbers with a decline of up to 70%: sea cucumber densities were around 0.35ind*m<sup>â2</sup> before the fishery opened and dropped to 0.1ind*m<sup>â2</sup> just after (Bradbury 1994). In Oregon,<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;</span>densities of this species are between 0.1 to 0.22ind*m<sup>â2</sup> at depths of 80 to 130m (Bruckner 2006). In Washington, the CPUE between 1995 and 1998 (Bradbury 1999) varied from 56 to a maximum of 80kg*diver<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>â1</sup>.<br/>&#160;<br/></p><p></p>",Stable,"<p>This species&#160;is distributed in the Pacific Coast of North America, from the Aleutians Islands, Alaska to Cedros Island, Baja California (Hamel and Mercier 2008).

Divers rotate their effort between 16 harvest areas, some of which are divided into more than 20 subâareas in an effort to maintain sustainability throughout the fishing grounds. In southeast Alaska, each fishing area is run on a three year rotation and harvested at a rate of 6 percent a year (B. Meredith pers. comm.). In any given area that is open for harvest, approximately 18% of the surveyed biomass is removed after which the area will remain closed for the next two years. The Alaskan fishery also closes down during the spawning season (Ruccio and Jackson 2002). Finally, harvest divers can only obtain permits for sea urchins or for sea cucumbers but not both (Bruckner 2006).</p><p></p>                              <p>In Washington State, the&#160;fishery for this species is a year-round dive operation. From 1971 to 1986, the fishery was opened in all areas. However, following signs of overfishing, the Washington State Department of Fisheries implemented a rotational harvest from 1987 to 1992 (Bradbury 1994). Now, the experimental trawl fishery is closed during softâshell Dungeness crab period and in shrimp areas. For each fished area, the quota is determined using surplus production models and estimates of biomass from catch-effort data, video surveys, and dive surveys. The current management in Washington includes spatial closures, licensing of collectors and an annual quota. Seven area closures for the dive fishery have been established in the current management plan and trawling is prohibited in shrimp areas. Other regulations for trawlers include no fishing in waters less that 20m deep. Divers in Washington need to submit their logbooks every month with data on date, depth, location and amount of captures (Bruckner 2006).</p>                              <p>In Oregon, the fishery for&#160;this species is conducted by divers. Harvest by trawl required an experimental gear permit until 2003. At present a permit is no longer required (McCrae 1994). In California, both this species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">P. parvimensis</span> are harvested. A special permit was required for sea cucumber harvest in 1992â1993. Separate permits for each gear type and a limit on the total number of permit were implemented in 1997. There are no restrictions on catch (Rogers-Bennett and Ono 2001, Schroeter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). Bruckner (2005) adds that a maximum of 111 dive permits and 36 trawl permits were issued in 1997, and this declined to 95 divers and 24 trawl permits in 2004. There are no restrictions on catch but trawling is prohibited in some conservation areas and along the shore of most islands (Bruckner 2005).</p><p>In British Columbia (Canada), the annual&#160;fishery for this species lasts for about three weeks in October, when muscle weight is greatest and the animals have reabsorbed their internal organs (DFO 2002). The commercial fishery is a small limitedâentry (i.e. 85 licences) dive fishery that is managed by individual quota (DFO 2002). Of the 85 licences delivered in 2003 in British   Columbia, 15 belonged to native peoples. Quotas are calculated by multiplying estimates of shoreline length, sea cucumber density, individual weight and harvest rate (DFO 2002). Only 25% of the coast is open to the commercial fishery. Up to an additional 25% may be used to conduct research, and the remaining 50 %&#160; is closed to harvesting until biologically-based management is possible. Abundance surveys and experimental fisheries are being conducted to estimate biomass and evaluate exploitation rate options (DFO, 2002). All landings are monitored by an independent industry-funded firm, dockside landings are only at designated ports, and licence holders pay a fee (Bruckner 2006).</p>","",,false,false,Global

2382480,195488,Squalus suckleyi,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus suckleyi</em>) is a moderately-sized benthic shark endemic to the North Pacific, and recently resurrected in 2010 as distinct from the Spiny Dogfish (<em>S. acanthias</em>). This species has been found to migrate extensively, even across the Pacific Ocean Basin, but there are relatively isolated stocks in Puget Sound (Washington, U.S.) and Strait of Georgia (British Columbia, Canada). Small target fisheries for this species are present in three different countries, as well as non-target catch and discards that are poorly known, underestimated, or completely unaccounted for. This species has life history characteristics that make it highly sensitive to over-exploitation including late maturity (~36 years for females), slow intrinsic growth rate (0.031â0.044 yr<sup>-1</sup>), low reproductive capacity, and high longevity (80 or more years). The gestation period of 18â24 months is the longest known for vertebrates. This species segregates by both size and sex, making some members of its population (mature females) more accessible to fishing by trawl and bottom longline, which are the main fisheries that exist in its range. Some fisheries management exists in a limited portion of the range for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but since this species is highly migratory, all countries and states must coordinate management of shared stocks for it to be effective. Multiple stocks have been identified but due to the absence of genetic differences among the stocks, they were assessed as one population.<br/><br/>In summary, the Northeast Pacific offshore stock is not overfished, and is possibly increasing based on the recent stock assessments. The Puget Sound inshore stock has historically been intensely fished but currently has relatively minor fisheries exploitation. The Strait of Georgia inshore stock has been categorized as being in a âcautiousâ state, but currently, only around half of the recommended Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is used. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Alaska are stable or increasing. The status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Northwest Pacific (Japan, Korea, Russia) is not as well known, but does not seem to be decreasing. In Japan, this species was historically fished and has remained at low levels, but the current fishing effort is low.<br/><br/>Considering that data indicate North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in different areas of the North Pacific Ocean basin have no genetic differences, that the fishing pressure in most of its range is minimal or negligible, and that the most recent available stock trends suggest that abundance is stable or increasing in the majority of its range, the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is categorized as Least Concern. However, we caution that the status of this species should be monitored closely because: (i) population trends of some stocks (Northwest Pacific) are uncertain, (ii) it has a very long generation length (51 years), and (iii) there is international demand for fins.","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish inhabits a wide depth range, from shallow waters down to 1,236 m (Ebert 2003). This species prefers water temperatures of 7â15ËC, and this preference drives both latitudinal and depth migrations (Ebert 2003). Some individuals and/or stocks of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish may be highly migratory (Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003, Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The maximum size is 130 cm total length (TL) and 107 cm TL for females and males, respectively (Ebert 2003). Males mature at 70â80 cm TL, and females mature at 80â100 cm TL (Ebert 2003). Age at 50% maturity is 36 years for females, and 21 years for males, and this species may live longer than 80 years (Saunders and McFarlane 1993, Vega <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparity, with an 18â24 month gestation period (Ketchen 1972, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Jones and Geen (1977) found that females reproduce every second year, and Tribuzio and Kruse (2012) found that a resting period between pregnancies of greater than or equal to one year might occur. Litter size ranges from 1â23 pups per breeding event, with an average of 8â12 depending on region (8.5 off Alaska) (Ketchen 1972, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Average size at birth is 25â27 cm TL (Ketchen 1972).<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exhibits late maturity, slow intrinsic rebound potential (estimated unfished r = 0.02â0.03 yr-1; Tribuzio and Kruse 2011), low reproductive capacity (~9 pups every 2+ years; Tribuzio and Kruse 2012), high longevity (80 or more years; Saunders and McFarlane 1993, Vega <em>et al</em>. 2009) and long generation time of 51 years (COSEWIC 2011). Furthermore, the size and sexual segregation of this species results in mature females (usually pregnant due to the long gestation period) being more vulnerable and influenced by fishing pressure than the other age classes (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2006a).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, despite being naturally abundant, are susceptible to overfishing due to its life history characters (see <em>Habitat and Ecology</em> section). The life history parameters of this species lend itself to be more sensitive to fishing mortality than the closely-related species, Spiny Dogfish (S. acanthias), which is assessed to be globally Vulnerable. The market for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is expected to increase due to the decline of more traditional groundfish stocks (Fordham 2009), closure of European Union Spiny Dogfish fisheries, and the continuing international demand for shark fins, especially from certified fisheries. The discards and non-target catch data are likely severely underestimated as well (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite all of these pressures, the trend data and stock statuses indicate that this species is not currently under any major threat and none are expected in the near future.<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has historically been landed both commercially and recreationally in most parts of its range. Catches and landings for each stock are listed separately below. For the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, many landings and fishery information are lumped together in most of the literature. The following paragraph is for all North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, and then below, if there is known information for a specific stock, it is described.<br/><br/>There are four major eras of the commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off the west coast of North America, starting with the 1870â1916 time period (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During this fishery, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were primarily exploited for reduction into oil for lubrication, lighting, and fertilizer (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highest volume of oil produced at this time was 1.2 million liters in 1883 (Ketchen 1986). The maximum average weight annually was almost 4,700 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this time period was 4,690 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The second era was from 1917â1939, and during this time North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for reduction into industrial oil and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch during this time was 4,486 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The third era from 1937â1950 was known as the âGreat Vitamin Liver fisheryâ where North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for their livers as a source of vitamin A (Ketchen 1986, Beamish et al. 2009). The landings during this time peaked at 31,000 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). After the discovery of synthetic vitamin A, the fishery collapsed (Ketchen 1986). During 1951â1974, the Canadian government subsidized the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish fishery. It is estimated that 6.7 million fish were taken during this time, all from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1980â2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). A fishery developed in Washington State in 1975 for human consumption, but the numbers fell through 1981 due to the decline of larger females (Ketchen 1986). In British Columbia, a fishery developed in 1977 for human consumption, with a peak in production in 1979 followed by sharp declines in the 1980s (Ketchen 1986).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>In the U.S., the offshore stock has been commercially fished since 1916 if not before, with two peaks: one in the 1940s (vitamin A liver fishery) and the other in the 1970s (food fishery) (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). During the vitamin A liver fishery, the landings peaked at 16,876 mt, with an average of 6,821 mt per year (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the past decade, the landings have remained lower, ranging from 164 to 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). As of September 2011, the MSC certified the âBritish Columbia North Pacific Spiny Dogfishâ fishery as sustainable (MSC 2011). The MSC is an international non-profit organization that oversees third party objective fishery assessments (MSC 2016a). If the assessment finds that a specific fishery has healthy stocks, minimal ecosystem impacts, and an effective fisheries management system, they certify the fishery as sustainable and label the seafood as such (MSC 2016a). The MSC fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish uses bottom longlines and trawl gear for both the offshore stock and the stock in the Strait of Georgia (MSC 2016b). Around 3,000 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken annually and this catch is lower than the current âTotal Allowable Catchâ (TAC) for British Columbia (9,250 mt; MSC 2011). In the U.S. today, most of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish commercially landed are from Washington State (accounts for 90% of landings in U.S.) and for the last 10 years, landings have ranged between 164 and 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). This species is commonly caught as bycatch today, with the majority discarded at sea (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). There are three fishing techniques that currently catch dogfish: trawl, hook and line, and a variety of nets (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The recreational catch of this species does not account for a large proportion (1% verses 99% commercial) of total landings, but this statistic does not include any discards, which are believed to be considerable since the general statistic for discards is that 91% of encountered North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are discarded at sea (Bargmann and Zielinski 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>The Puget Sound inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>This stock has experienced two catch peaks in the past 80 years in terms of commercial fishing, and is currently at low levels (Palsson 2009). Before World War II, the catches were below 1,000 mt per year, and beginning in the 1940s, landings increased from less than a few hundred mt per year to over 4,000 mt per year (Palsson 2009). Following that peak, catches declined in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 1,000 mt per year, and almost to zero in the early 1970s (Palsson 2009). The mid-1970s marked the beginning of the second peak, with catches increasing to over 1,500 mt per year in the late 1970s through early 1980s, peaking at 4,000 mt per year in 1979 (Palsson 2009). In the following years (mid-1980s through mid-1990s), the harvest further declined to less than 1,000 mt per year and then to 300 mt per year starting in 1997 (Palsson 2009). These catch data do not include discards (Palsson 2009). Between 1982 and 2000, &gt;70% of the harvest was from the northern part of the Sound, although during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the harvest was more equal between the northern and southern Sound (Palsson 2009). The Washington [State] Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Puget Sound Survey indicated that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance was at a low level, but the estimates from 2001 were higher than 1997 (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>The commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Strait of Georgia dates back to the 1800s, with several peaks and troughs throughout its history. In the first era during 1870â1916, 65% of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exploited were from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the second era from 1917â1939, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were almost exclusively taken from the Strait of Georgia, with an estimation of 143,038 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The annual average catch was 4,486 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the government subsidized fishing era (1951â1974), 6.7 million fish, or 22,872 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from the Strait of Georgia (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Again, from 1980â2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish et al. 2009). Since 2006, commercial fisheries for groundfish have 100% observer at-sea monitoring to account for bycatch (Mawani 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this stock are also caught in the certified MSC fishery (see above).<br/><br/><strong><em>Alaskan stock</em></strong>: <br/>There is no directed fishery in Alaska (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011), although this species makes up a large proportion of bycatch in many economically valuable fisheries, namely longline fisheries for sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>), Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) (Conrath and Foy 2009, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Information on the bycatch in Alaska is as follows, and is taken from the pre-STAR report for the Pacific Management Fishery Council meeting 11â15 July 2011 to asses the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, and is from various sources. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken from the Gulf of Alaska in the Pacific Salmon gillnet fisheries, sablefish fisheries, Pacific Halibut longline fisheries, and groundfish trawl fisheries (Boldt 2003 in Gertseva and Taylor 2011). Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that an average of 530 tons per year of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from 1997â2007. Furthermore, the bycatch from State waters is not completely known (but estimates are documented in various reports, e.g. <a href=""https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf"">https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf</a>) and the bycatch from Federal waters are considered to be a conservative estimate due to the incomplete observing of fisheries (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The NMFS and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Gulf of Alaska surveys that collectively cover 1984â2003 indicate that there is a stable trend with increasing catch rates in 2003, and overall both indicate that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Gulf of Alaska are stable or even increasing (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>In Japan, this species has historically been landed and used. Beginning in 1990, a fishery developed for the bycatch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from bottom longline fishing vessels targeting Pacific cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) or Pacific halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) in Hokkaido, and Aomori, Akita, and Ishikawa prefectures (northern part of Honshu, and central area of the Japan Sea coast, respectively). The fishery intensity reflected the oscillating price of fishmeal fertilizer (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Hokkaido, a bottom gillnet fishery (with the exception of one prefecture using longline) developed during the same time (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). During WWII, the bottom longline fishery expanded off Hokkaido and then into the sea of Okhotsk after WWII resulting from the increased demand from increased numbers of fish meal and liver oil factories (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Industrial bottom trawling for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish began, but soon shifted to bottom longlining (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). The âtotal shark landing of Japan' was 50,000 mt in 1947 but it soon increased to 120,000 mt in 1950 (Taniuchi 1990 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1951â1955, the average North Pacific Spiny Dogfish catch was over 44,000 mt (Nakano et al. 2009). From 1956â1959 the catch was about 30,000 mt per year, and from 1959â1967, the catch decreased steadily to less than 10,000 mt per year (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately, in 1968, landing statistics for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>), Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), and âotherâ shark were combined into one category (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Since the 1950s, catches have greatly declined, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) stated that it was probably due to a reduction in stocks, decreased demand, and low prices (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Most recently, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are caught in the offshore bottom trawl fishery, with catches ranging from 1,000 mt (1970s) to less than 500 mt in recent years (Nakano et al. 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish continues to be caught incidentally in local and offshore industrial fisheries (Nakano et al. 2009). Since North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are currently caught in the Aomori prefecture with bottom longlines, the larger females are more vulnerable due to their schooling and demersal nature (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Currently, the majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is caught by the offshore bottom trawl fishery (Kitagawa 2005 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009) and bottom longline fishery (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009), which selectively fishes for the mature members of the population, frequently mature pregnant females. Catch rates in Danish seines and bull trawls fell 90% from 100â200 kg per haul in the mid 1970s to 10â20 kg per haul in the late 1990s (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2003 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the decline in fishing effort in the inshore waters, (specifically the number of tows by the Japanese Danish seine fishery) since 2003, the CPUE (kg/tow) has increased in the same time period (Nakano et al. 2009). In addition, the fishery effort had increased from the early 1970s through 1990, and decreased since (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) concluded that the Japanese population of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish decreased historically and stayed low. In addition, Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported that an assessment report by Kitagawa (2005), that stated that the life history parameters of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish prevented it from restoring to pre-fished levels, and that fishing effort should not be increased.<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>: <br/>In Russian waters, a directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish occurred pre-WWII, in which several mt were exploited annually (multiple authors in Orlov and Tokranov 2009). Currently, there is no directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but they are incidentally caught in the Pacific salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp.) fisheries (Grigorov and Orlov 2013). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are commonly caught near the bottom off the coast of Eastern Russia (around the Sea of Okhotsk), Kuril Islands, Aleutian Islands, and eastern Bering Sea (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was previously assessed to be Vulnerable as subpopulations of the Spiny Dogfish (<em>S. acanthias</em>) in the Northeast Pacific and as Endangered in the Northwest Pacific. However, in the majority of the range of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, the population appears to be either stable or increasing. To that end, we have listed the current population trend for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish as stable. This species has had a long history of exploitation and decline, but over the past decade, only small-scale targeted fisheries have existed, and the literature confirms that the majority of the population was found to be stable, if not increasing.<br/><br/>No genetic differences exist among North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in different regions of the Pacific Ocean Basin (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). âStocksâ as used here are not genetically distinct groups but divided based upon movement and exchange of individuals. It is thought that there are at least three stocks off the coast of North America: one offshore stock from Alaska to Baja California, and one each in both the Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1984, Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009, Brodeur <em>et al</em>. 2009, Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further work is needed to clarify the degree of connectivity of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off Alaska to those in Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, and the to the offshore stock (Conrath and Foy 2009, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian waters, Saunders (1989) estimated that one-half to two-thirds constitutes the offshore stock, with the remaining in the inshore stock (Strait of Georgia). No estimate was found for the proportion of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. portion of the offshore stock verses the stock in south Puget Sound, the U.S. portion of the sound. The highest known densities in North America occur off British Columbia and Washington State, with density declining southward (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is thought that the stocks in the Sea of Japan and off the coast of Japan (Pacific Ocean) are separate (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). While transoceanic migrations from the U.S. West Coast to the Pacific Coast of Japan have been documented, the degree of connectivity between the two is not completely known (Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003).<br/><br/>Population trends for each stock are discussed below.<br/><br/><strong><em>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>In U.S. Pacific coastal waters, the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was estimated to be at 53% of the unexploited level, which does not meet the requirements to be considered overfished (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In addition, the historical abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has always been above the management target (defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output), and in the past 10 years, a 1% relative exploitation rate (see Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, the British Columbian portion of the offshore stock is listed in the âhealthy zoneâ with a maximum sustainable yield biomass (BMSY) of over 80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). This assessment also reported a biomass estimate of 210,063â318,841 mt, or 63â96% of the initial biomass (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). The long-term trend from the Hecate Strait survey shows that the stock appears to be stable (Wallace et al. 2009). In addition, data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) West Coast triennial survey have not indicated that there has been a change in abundance (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Puget Sound inshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>For geographical clarification, here, Puget Sound proper is considered to be South Puget Sound, with the northern region belonging to the Strait of Georgia (McFarlane and King 2009). The population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Puget Sound was judged to have declined based on groundfish stock assessments from the region (Palsson 2009; PSAT 1998, 2000, 2002), with data from both fishery-dependent and -independent âassessment techniquesâ (see Palsson 2009). Coincidental declines in the commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) since 1997 were found (Palsson 2009), and the biomass indicators from bottom-trawl surveys show a marked decline from the mid-1990s and forward, corresponding to declines in total harvest and CPUE for set-nets (Palsson 2009). In addition, there was a 64% decline in biomass found from surveys in 1987â1991 and surveys conducted thereafter (Palsson 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>There have been contrasting stock statuses found for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia. In the U.S. portion, an 82% decline in biomass over the past three decades has been found (see Palsson 2009). This is in direct contrast to the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Canadian proportion, which, based upon fishery performance and survey abundance, have remained stable or are actually increasing from the mid-1980s to 2005 (King and McFarlane 2009, Wallace et al. 2009). King and McFarlane (2009) examined the trends in North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the Strait of Georgia from 1980â2005, and concluded that the relative abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has remained stable over the past 20 years. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2009) looked at the CPUE from the southwest region of Vancouver Island and Hecate Strait, and concluded that the outside stock is stable and fishing pressure is low relative to the size of the estimated population. In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, biomass estimated from two different models categorize this stock in the âcautious zoneâ as the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) is between 40â80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). Palsson (2009) notes that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the northern portion of Puget Sound was higher in 2004â2005 than previous years, which he suggests may be due to recovery or immigrants from the Canadian population. Due to the conflicting views of population trend data in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia, more work is needed to clarify the abundance trend.<br/><br/>A recent Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) report summarized the available survey indices and found that most are moderate or poor in quality with respect to estimating North Pacific Spiny Dogfish trends mainly because they span less than one generation (51 years) (COSEWIC 2011). Consequently the indices are highly variable and uncertain. It was recognized that the mean size of individuals captured has declined over time since the earliest available data were from 1970â1990s (COSEWIC 2011).<br/><br/><em><strong>Alaskan Stock</strong></em>:<br/>Conrath and Foy (2009) examined CPUE from the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands, incidental catch, and abundance from surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (CPUE data collected years 1984â2007), the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) (CPUE collected years 1997â2006), and NMFSâs North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program (CPUE for years 1979â1994 for Japanese-U.S. cooperative longline survey; 1988â2007 for U.S. only longline survey; incidental catch years 1990â2007; abundance in Gulf of Alaska 1984â2007) to determine the abundance, distribution, and status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Alaska. Based upon CPUE abundance indices and incidental catch rates, they found that decadal trends in abundance showed an increase in the central and eastern Gulf of Alaska in recent years (see Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/>In summary, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian Pacific waters are considered to be stable, as three separate surveys have indicated no long-term upward or downward trend (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the U.S., North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance appears stable or increasing off of Alaska, stable for the offshore stock, and at a low level in Puget Sound (but with little fishing pressure) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>Trends for this area are scarce, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009), after reviewing the fisheries, utilisation, and stock status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, stated that assessing the trend for this area would be difficult based upon the data at hand (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). These researchers did project that the population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in this area had declined historically and remained low (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Yet, fishermen are attempting to avoid them as bycatch and directed fishing effort is decreasing (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>:<br/>The status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Northwest Pacific is largely unknown, but the range over the past decade may have expanded due to temperature fluctuations and climate change (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p></p>",Stable,"The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is endemic to the North Pacific, from the West Coast of North America to the coasts of Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The range of this species extends northward to Russia and Alaska, eastward to the Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington, and south to Baja California, Mexico (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has a long history of use and trade dating as far back as 2650 B.C. The majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish landed in North American Pacific waters have historically been used as a source of vitamin A, liver oil, a food source for human consumption, and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Bargmann 2009, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Historical landings from Japan were mostly used for liver oil, fishmeal, human consumption, fish jelly, egg product, and shark fins (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Use and trade for other regions in this speciesâ range is unknown at this time.<br/><br/>In the active Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fishery in British Columbia, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are mostly exported to European and Asian countries as backs (backbones in), belly flaps, fins, tails, organic liquid fertilizer, and dried cartilage (MSC 2011).<br/><br/>In the 2010 proposal to include the Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>) on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), it is stated that the Northeast Pacific (Alaska to California) stock is not of concern in terms of regulating trade (CITES 2010).",Marine,"<p>                  </p><p>Management exists in a very small area of this speciesâ range (Fordham <em>et al. </em>2006a, 2006b), and it is still taken as non-target catch in many fisheries or discarded at sea (Conrath and Foy 2009). Regulations are in place for British Columbia; North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are included in the integrated fisheries management plan under âother speciesâ with a total allowable catch (TAC) (the TAC has not been restrictive as the catch is lower than the allotment), allocation information, time, area, and gear restrictions, and enforcement requirements for each fishery for the fishing season (Mawani 2009). For the MSC certified fishery, the TAC for British Columbia is 14,000 mt with 9,520 mt accessible to the longline sector and 4,480 mt accessible by the trawl sector (MSC 2011). This fishery has 100% monitoring on-board and at landing sites to record all fishing activities. In Puget Sound, both the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the treaty tribes of Puget Sound manage North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (Palsson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Palsson 2009). The Pacific Fishery Management Council federally regulates this species off of the Pacific Coast of the United States, having included it into the âother fishâ category in the groundfish management plan, but catches are not limited (PFMC 2008, Bargmann 2009). In Japan, there are no regulations in place for this species, and in a 2005 assessment, there were recommendations to not increase fishing pressure (Nakano <em>et al.</em> 2009). Regulations for Russian and the Koreas were not found during this assessment. </p>","",,false,false,Global

Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with oophagy and histrophy, with litter sizes of 2â17 and  a suspected two to three year reproductive cycle (Francis 1996, Uchida <em>et al. </em>1996,<strong> </strong>Mollet and Cailliet 2002, Bruce 2008, Domeier 2012, Sato <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Western Indian Oceans, female age-at-maturity of 30â33 years and maximum age of&#160; 30â73 years were reported based on bomb radiocarbon validated ages (Hamady&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Andrews and Kerr 2015, Natanson and Skomal 2015,&#160;Christiansen<em> et al. </em>2016). Due to the accurate method of bomb radiocarbon ageing, these are possibly more accurate than the previous lower estimates of female age-at-maturity of 7â15 years and maximum ages of 18â30 years (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1985, Wintner and Cliff 1999, Bruce 2008, Tanaka<em> et al.</em> 2011, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using the precautionary approach and the validated, most conservative bomb radiocarbon ages of age-at-maturity of 33 years and maximum age of 73 years, generation length is 53 years.<strong></strong><strong> </strong>The bomb radiocarbon maximum age is accepted as being likely  &gt;30 years, minimum of 44 years, and possibly maximum of 73 years. The  female age-at-maturity is possibly more contentious and to explore the sensitivity of the global population trend analyses to the younger female age-at-maturity, estimates of female age-at-maturity of 15 years and maximum age of 44 years were also used, that led to a generation length of 29.5 years (see Population section).","<p>The White Shark is caught as bycatch mostly in inshore fisheries in a range of gears, such as longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, hand-held rod and reel, and fish-traps; it is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries (Bruce 2008, Lowe <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dewar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2013, Francis 2017, Onate-Gonzalez <em>et al. </em>2017). The species has a relatively high post-release survival in net fisheries (Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2013, Benson <em>et al. </em>2018). The White Shark is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Bruce 2008, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Braccini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018, Lee<em> et al. </em>2018, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). A shark control program in RÃ©union Island targets Tiger Sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>) and Bull Sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), with no captures of White Sharks reported to date (Florida Museum 2019).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the White Shark. Genetic data suggest one global population; however, there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins, potentially within ocean basins, and likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Pardini <em>et al</em>. 2001, Jorgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Gubili <em>et al</em>. 2012, O'Leary <em>et al</em>. 2015, Andreotti<em> et al. </em>2016, Bernand <em>et al</em>. 2018). White Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 5,460 in eastern Australasia in 2017 (uncertainty range: 2,909â12,802) (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al. </em>2018); in excess of 2,000 in the Northeast Pacific in 2012 (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014); and, in South Africa: 1,279 in KwaZulu-Natal in 1996 (Cliff <em>et al.</em> 1996), 908 in Gansbaai from 2007â2011 (95% CI: 808â1,008) (Towner <em>et al</em>. 2013), 723 in False Bay from 2004â2012 (95% CI: 466â980) (Hewitt 2014), 389 from 2008â2010 in Mossel Bay (95% CI: 351â428) (Ryklief 2012), and 438 for all of South Africa in 2011 (Andreotti <em>et al</em>. 2016), although there are concerns for the validity of this last estimate (Irion <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) standardized relative abundance in the Northwest Atlantic (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014); and standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) the Northeast Pacific (Dewar<em> et al.</em> 2013); (3) the South Pacific (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011); and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) updated with data to 2012 (S. Wintner pers. comm. 3/10/2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).</p><span lang=""EN-US"">    <p>First, the Curtis <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) relative abundance was used to represent data on catches in the Northwest Atlantic as it is the longest and most comprehensive compilation of data available for the region. It includes fishery-independent longline surveys, observer data from the shark-target bottom longline fishery, and recreational fishing tournament data. The relative abundance trend indicates historically higher abundances in the 1960s followed by a declining trend until the mid-1980s, and then an increasing trend since the 1990s, when a range of management measures were implemented (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014). The three generation trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic CPUE for 1961â2010 (50 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 80.8% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. This probability of a high level of reduction is over a very long period of three generations; it has incorporated the reductions from historically higher abundances and projected an estimated trend based on those reductions for a considerable period beyond that of the time-series and is thus indicative of historic declines rather than the recent increasing trend since 1990.<br/></p><p>Second, in the Northeast Pacific, White Sharks have mainly been taken in inshore net fisheries. Fisheries catch data were available from the California set net fishery which accounts for the majority of White Shark bycatch in that area; this indicated declines during the 1980s followed by a gradual increase from 1990s onwards (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on those data, information from photo-identification studies, and other researchers, the status review of White Shark in the Northeast Pacific concluded that the White Shark abundance was stable or increasing although there was some uncertainty around this conclusion due to the limited long-term abundance data for the region (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). The trend analysis of the Northeast Pacific California set net fishery CPUE for 1980â2010 (31 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 4.1%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 602.1% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths.<br/></p><p>Third, one of the longest datasets in the South Pacific is from the east coast of Australia shark meshing program in New South Wales (1950â2009) in which White Shark standardized CPUE markedly declined from 1950 to the 1990s after which it began to slowly increase (Reid <em>et al. 2</em>011). During this period there were modifications to net specifications and spatial and temporal effort, and since 2010, further changes have been implemented that include a reduction in net soak time (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, NSW DPI 2018). From 2008 to 2018, catches of White Sharks in the meshing program have fluctuated between 3 and 26 individuals annually, with increasing catches in the latter years (NSW DPI 2018). Further north along Australia's east coast, the standardized CPUE of White Sharks also declined significantly, by 92% over 54 years (1962â2015) in the Queensland Shark Control Program (Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). The trend analysis of the NSW shark meshing program CPUE for 1950â2009 (60 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with an estimated  median reduction of 95.8% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Since mid-1990s protection of White Sharks in Australia, adult White Sharks abundance has been estimated to have slightly declined or remained stable with population growth rates unlikely to be greater than 3% per year (Bruce<em> et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Based on the current <span lang=""EN-US"">eastern Australasian abundance estimate and species demographics (assuming continued protection) there should potentially be an increase in the eastern Australasian abundance as the current juvenile cohorts enter into maturity (R. Bradford pers. comm. 07/02/2019).<br/></span></p><p>Fourth, long-term standardized CPUE in shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa beaches in the Western Indian Ocean fluctuated considerably but was stable over time (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend analysis of the shark net CPUE for 1978â2012 (35 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.1%, consistent with an estimated  median increase of 13.1% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths. In the West Australian Indian Ocean, the White Shark modeled abundance is not predicted to have increased by more than 10% since 1997 when protection was enacted (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p><span lang=""EN-US""><p>Further to the above data and analyses, in the Mediterranean Sea, based on anecdotal records and limited fisheries data, the White Shark is suspected to have declined by at least 80% over 69 years from 1947â2016 (Soldo <em>et al.</em> 2016). With the exception of the Mediterranean Sea, in all other regions with data, the status review and studies indicate that the White Shark has declined  during the 1980s and has begun to show signs of increasing since  protection has been implemented. </p><p>Across the regions, the White Shark is estimated to be declining from historic levels in the Northwest Atlantic and South Pacific, and increasing in the Northeast Pacific and Indian Ocean. The trends among ocean regions are highly variable and while they are mostly based on long datasets, they are extrapolated over a very long three generation length of 159 years which increases the uncertainty in the estimated regional trends. With the exception of the Northwest Atlantic, they are also based on datasets from limited areas within each region and may not accurately represent the trend in White Shark across the entire region. Despite these caveats, the trend data are the best available and were used for the estimation of a global population trend; the estimated three generation population trend for each region was weighted according to the relative size of each region.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The overall  estimated median reduction was 53.8%,  with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three  generation  lengths (159 years).

It is more frequently found close to land and in temperate waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of 573 cm total length (TL), and possibly 635 cm TL; size at birth is 120â150 cm TL, males mature at 260â420 cm TL, and females mature at 260â465 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Young <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous oophagous with litter sizes of 2â6 pups and an annual or biennial reproductive cycle (Gubanov 1978, Cailliet and Bedford 1983, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Gervelis and Natanson 2013). The potential annual rate of population increase under sustainable fishing is higher than that of the Pelagic Thresher&#160;and Bigeye Thresher&#160;and has been estimated at 0.254 (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008). Female age at maturity is estimated at 13 years and maximum age is 38 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages from the Northwest Atlantic (Natanson <em>et al.</em>  2016). In the Eastern Central Pacific, age-at-maturity estimates are  much younger, though not validated with female age-at-maturity at 5.3  years and maximum age at 22 years off California  (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is possible these are regional  differences in life history parameters, but adopting a precautionary  approach, the validated bomb radiocarbon ages are used for both regions  to give a generation length of 25.5 years.</p>","The Common Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic&#160;longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between the Northwest Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans (Trejo 2005).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) relative abundance data in the North Atlantic (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016); and, (2) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Eastern North Pacific (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the relative abundance observer time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992â2013 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had stabilized, while noting that fishing pressure had been present for more than two decades prior to 1992 and that the abundance had stabilized at lower abundance than unexploited biomass (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992â2013 (22 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 97.0% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized, the 4.6% annual rate of reduction in the time-series produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the nominal logbook CPUE from California, United States west coast swordfish/shark drift gillnet fishery for 1981â2013 (33 years) was used as it considered the most important west coast commercial fishery for Common Thresher (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Common Thresher stock declined steeply in the early 1980s, then stabilized in the mid-1980s after regulations were implemented, and then increased through to ~2000 before stabilizing again, with the current stock considered close to unexploited level and unlikely to be overfished (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981â2013 (33 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.6%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 18.7% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, in the Southwest Atlantic CPUE of Common Thresher declined by 97% between 2002 and 2005 (Berrondo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The Common Thresher showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.11 (time range 108 years) and biomass of -0.10 (time range 108 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The Common Thresher is estimated to be declining in the North Atlantic and increasing in the Eastern North Pacific. However, the increasing trend in the Eastern North Pacific is from a managed fishery and may not be representative of trends in the wider Pacific. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median population reduction was 47.0%, with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths (76.5 years). However, as the trends are uncertain and there is a lack of data from other regions of the world, expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate a global population reduction of 30â49% over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

Males mature at 166â204 cm TL and females at 265â312 cm TL (Pratt and Casey 1983,  Stevens 1983, Cliff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1990, Francis and Duffy 2005, Varghese <em>et al. </em>2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an estimated gestation period of 15â18  months and a three-year reproductive cycle (Mollet and Cailliet 2002). Litter size is 4â25 pups (possibly up to 30, mostly 10â18) with a size at birth of 60â70 cm TL (Garrick 1967, Compagno 2001). Female age at maturity varies from 18â21 years and maximum age from 28â32 years in New Zealand, the Southwest Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Northwest Atlantic Oceans; generation length is therefore 24â25 years (Bishop<em> et al. </em>2006, Natanson <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2013, DoÃ±o <em>et al. </em>2014, Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<p><br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>The Shortfin Mako is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The majority of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, MartÃ­nez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2017), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015, Campana <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality, although such mortality is reported at 10% for recreational fishing (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, French<em> et al. </em>2015). Commercial post-release mortality has  been reported as 30â33% for the Shortfin Mako on longlines (Campana <em>et al. </em>2016b). The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>  </p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Shortfin Mako. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins (Schrey and Heist 2003, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) stock assessments in the north Atlantic and south Atlantic (ICCAT 2017); (2) stock assessment in the north Pacific (ISC 2018); (3) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the south Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014); and (4) a preliminary stock assessment in the Indian Ocean (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, while the previous north Atlantic stock assessment suggested low probability of overfishing and that stocks were healthy (ICCAT 2012), the most recent north Atlantic stock assessment revealed that the stock was both overfished and that overfishing was occurring (ICCAT 2017). The south Atlantic stock assessment biomass estimates were deemed unreliable by the stock assessors, although they inferred that fishing mortality is likely unsustainable (ICCAT 2017). This concern is corroborated by a recent analysis of standardized catch rates of Shortfin Mako on longlines in the south Atlantic that revealed steep declines of 99% in the average CPUE of 1979â1997 and 1998â2007 (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016a). As a result of the unreliable stock assessment, the north Atlantic stock assessment was considered as representative of the south Atlantic for the trend analysis. The trend analysis of the north Atlantic modelled biomass for 1950â2017 (68 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated median decline of 60.0% over three generation lengths (75 years), with the highest probability of 50â79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the north Pacific stock assessment revealed that the stock was likely not overfished and that overfishing was likely not occurring (ISC 2018). The trend analysis of the modelled spawning abundance for 1975â2016 (42 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.6%, consistent with a median decline of 36.5% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30â49% reduction over three generation lengths. Although the stock assessment used a long data time series of 40 years, the trend analysis considered the population change over a longer period of 72 years, which results in a greater decline than that of the stock assessment.<br/><br/>Third, the New Zealand longline observer Shortfin Mako standardized CPUE for 1995â2013 (19 years) (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014) was used to represent the catches in that region as it is observer data with good coverage, comes from the part of the region with highest catch rates, and Shortfin Mako move between New Zealand waters and areas further north. The trend analysis indicated annual rates of increase of 0.5%, consistent with a median increase of 35.2% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the Indian Ocean preliminary stock assessment indicated that the Shortfin Mako stock is not currently overfished but subject to overfishing, however the biomass trajectories trend towards overfished with overfishing status (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1971â2015 (45 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.9%, consistent with a median decline of 47.9% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30â49% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Shortfin Mako and Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.12 (time range 135 years) and biomass of -0.15 (time range 106 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferreti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Shortfin Mako was estimated to be declining in all oceans, other than the south Pacific where it is increasing. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 46.6%, with the highest probability of 50â79% reduction over three generation lengths (72â75 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Endangered A2.",Decreasing,The Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrnchus</em>) is widespread in temperate and  tropical waters of all oceans (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).,"<p></p><p>This is one of the most valuable shark species due to its high-quality meat. The meat is utilized fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried-salted for human consumption. The fins of the Shortfin Mako are commonly traded, comprising 1.2% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields <em>et al. </em>2017). The liver oil, jaws, and skin are also used (Compagno 2001).</p>",Marine,"<p>  </p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. In 2008, the Shortfin Mako was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Partiesâ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation. In 2018, Mexico announced its intention to propose adding the Shortfin Mako to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). If the proposal is adopted at the 2019 CITES Conference, Shortfin Mako exports from CITES Parties would need to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>Globally, there are very few limits on Shortfin Mako catch. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Shortfin Mako and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Whereas the European Union implemented this measure through domestic regulations, it has yet to limit Shortfin Mako catch from anywhere else, even as Spain is consistently the worldâs top Shortfin Mako fishing nation. A 2017 measure agreed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;â&#160;in response to scientific advice to ban retention of overfished north Atlantic Shortfin Makos&#160;â&#160;instead aims to maximize live release by narrowing the conditions under which Shortfin Makos from this population can be landed.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended Shortfin Mako landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on Shortfin Mako catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, and promotion of safe release protocols are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It occurs near the surface in temperate waters and deeper, below the thermocline, in tropical waters. The species has low biological productivity with limited fecundity and late age-at-maturity. Although no longer targeted, it is still caught as bycatch in trawl, trammel nets, and set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines. The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade. Across regions, there have been some severe  historic decline, however there are indications of some stability  and possible slow recovery since cessation of target fishing and high levels of protection.  The global population may now be beginning  to stabilize, with signs of that from the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere there is little information upon which is assess stability.<strong> </strong>However, abundances  are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is  ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a global population reduction of 50â79% is suspected over the past three generations (102 years). Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Basking Shark is a planktivorous coastal-pelagic species named for its habit of swimming slowly at the surface but it also vertical migrates to depths of 1,264 m (Gore <em>et al. </em>2008). It occurs in temperate and tropical waters, but in temperate waters it is present near the surface and in tropical and equatorial waters, it occurs deeper, below the thermocline (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dewar <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is the second largest shark after the Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>)  and reaches a maximum estimated size of 10,276â10,973 cm total length  (TL) (Parker and Stott 1965, Holden 1974, Weigmann 2016). The species  aggregates in coastal waters, with aggregations of up to 1,398  individuals observed in the northeast United States, and it also undertakes large-scale  migrations (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009, Witt <em>et al. </em>2014, Doherty <em>et al.</em> 2017, Crowe <em>et al. </em>2018, Dewar<em> et al.</em>  2018). Males mature at 400â750 cm TL, females mature at 690â980 cm  TL, and size at birth is estimated at 150â200 cm TL (Matthews and Parker  1950, Parker and  Stott 1965, Pauly  1978, Compagno 1984, Sims&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Fowler 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013,  Francis 2017).

Annual rate of population increase is estimated at 0.013â0.023 and  natural mortality is low at M = ~0.07 per year (Pauly 2002,  Fowler 2005).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Currently there are no target fisheries for the Basking Shark, however it was targeted for several centuries by harpoon and net fisheries for meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and liver oil (Rose 1996, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018, SARA 2019). Surface fisheries have primarily caught large, recently-mated females (CITES 2002). The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade being worth up to US$57,000 for a single, large fin (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2004, Magnussen <em>et al. </em>2007).

Basking Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 4,200 and 632 (CI: 377â1,058) in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in 2007 and  2011, respectively (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al. </em>2014); 10,125  in Canadian Northwest Atlantic waters in 2007 (highly uncertain estimate) (Campana  <em>et al.</em> 2008); 6,671â14,925 in New England shelf waters, United States in 1982 (Kenney <em>et al.</em> 1985); 985 on the west coast of Scotland in 2010 (95% CI: 495â1,683) (Gore <em>et al. </em>2016); and, possibly 19,151 (+/-10,629) for Scotland and Ireland combined (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Landings and sightings data are available from the Northeast Atlantic (e.g.&#160;CITES 2002, Southall&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Speedie<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009, Witt<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, ICES 2018); landings data are available from Japanese waters (Yokawa 2017); and, sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) are available from New Zealand (Francis 2017, M. Francis unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, the landings of Basking Sharks declined  dramatically during the period 1946â2017 (CITES 2002, ICES 2018). Landings within  ICES Subareas 1â14 peaked in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s at around 5,000  tonne (t), declined rapidly during the 1980s to less than 1,000 t  annually, after which there was a peak in 1992 of 1,697 t, followed by a rapid decline. There is evidence of serial exploitation and depletion patterns in different ICES Subareas during this fishery. For example,  the artisanal Achill Island fishery, which targeted Basking Sharks in a  single bay with rowing boats, nets, and hand harpoons, declined rapidly after a  decade of high catches during the 1950s and 1960s, and Basking Sharks did not return to this location (CITES 2002). Following the ban on target Basking Shark  fisheries in 2006â2007, landings  declined to &lt;30 t annually and have  been &lt;0.1 t since 2013  (ICES 2018). There are no effort data or catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data available for recent  years (ICES 2018) which means caution  is required in the interpretation of these data for population abundance  trends.<strong>&#160;</strong>However, the large catch declines during the  1960s to 1980s are believed to reflect unsustainable fishing levels and a  decline in population abundance (CITES 2002, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since then, public record sightings and boat  surveys in  the U.K. for 1988â2008 suggest population recovery following  cessation  of targeting in the mid-2000s, based on decreased sightings of  small  Basking Sharks and increased sightings of medium-sized and large  sharks  (Witt <em>et al. </em>2012). However, when current research  survey  encounter rates are compared with historical target fishery catch   rates, the population is estimated to be well below 30% of historical   abundance, although it is suspected to be stable and possibly increasing in   European waters (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the Japanese target Basking Shark fishery of the 1960s and 1970s,  estimates of catches (in numbers) severely declined during the mid-1970s from a high of about 100 individuals per year until the  fishery closed in the early 1980s, with catches since then at, or near, zero (Uchida 1995, Yokawa 2017). These data are unusual, having records of the same catch (100 sharks) annually from 1967 to 1974 followed by a 50% increase in 1975 and an 87% decrease in 1976, with no information on effort; hence they must be interpreted with caution. In New Zealand, the SPUE over the period 1985â2015 peaked in 1988â1991, which may  have been due to Japanese trawl vessels targeting sharks during that time, but since the mid-2000s catches have been at, or near, zero. The reason for this decline cannot be definitively determined as it may be indicative of changed fishing practices,  regional shifts in availability of Basking Sharks, or a real abundance  decline (Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis 2017). The Japanese and New Zealand data may not be reliable indices of abundance.</p><p>Further to the landings and SPUE data above, there are estimates of population  changes from five regions: Northwest Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Southwest  Pacific. In the Canadian Northwest Atlantic, declines were estimated in  the Bay of Fundy between 2008 and 2011 based on aerial and boat surveys  from different studies, although direct comparison between the two  abundance estimates is constrained by different estimation methods  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore,  population models in 2008 suggested a 23% probability that the abundance  was decreasing, although there was high uncertainty in the model data  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008). In United States Atlantic waters, there has been no evidence of decline since 1979 (Campana <em>et al</em>.  2008). Population trends in the  Mediterranean Sea are unknown, but it is suspected that the Basking Shark  has declined by at least 50% over three generations (Sims <em>et al. </em>2016).  In temperate waters of the Southwest Atlantic, Basking Shark were  historically common and are now rare (Soto 2000, Lucifora <em>et al. </em>2015).  In the Northeast Pacific, the Basking Shark was persecuted as a  destructive 'pest' and although targeted fisheries ceased in the  1970s,  the abundance is considered to still be at a historic low with fewer  than 6 sightings per year off the coast of British Colombia (Wallace and Gisborne 2006, McFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Dewar <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Southwest Pacific, the New Zealand Threat Classification  System found that the Basking Shark was Vulnerable based on the criteria that the population size within New Zealand is likely to be &lt;5,000 mature individuals, with a predicted decline over three generations of 10â50% (Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong></strong>Across  these regions, there have been some severe historic declines, however, the global population may now be beginning to stabilize, following cessation of target fishing, high levels of protection, and indications of recovery (particularly in the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere we have little information upon which is assess stability). Recovery is expected to take  hundreds of years due to the low biological productivity of Basking  Shark, exacerbated by the removal of adult females by target fisheries (CITES 2002). Abundances are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a 50â79% global  population reduction is suspected over the past three generations (102 years).  Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Basking Shark occurs mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; in the Indian Ocean, it is reported only from southern Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fahmi and White 2015).</p>","<p>No utilization or commercial trade of this species is currently known to exist, although prior to 2012, meat and fins were exported from Norway and fins from New Zealand.

However, it is likely that if caught, the meat would still be used fresh for  either local consumption or exported internationally along with the  fins.</p><p><br/></p><p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. The Basking Shark was among the first shark species listed under several wildlife treaties. Many fishing nations worldwide and the European Union protect Basking Sharks through wildlife conservation legislation or apply zero quotas under fisheries management regulations.<br/><br/>In 2002, the Basking Shark was added to Appendix II of CITES, which requires Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2005, the Basking Shark was listed on Appendix I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which respectively, obligates Parties to strictly protect the species and to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted its first ban on directed Basking Shark fisheries in the Convention Area. This measure has since been regularly renewed; the current ban, adopted in 2015, expires at the end of 2019 and will be reconsidered based on scientific advice (ICES 2016). There are a range of conservation measures in the UK, along with a recommended Basking Shark code of conduct (OSPAR 2009). The Basking Shark is listed on Appendix II of the Bern  Convention for the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Basking Shark and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Basking Shark retention and landings be prohibited, at least as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Initiatives to avoid contact, prevent capture, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties (MarLIN 2018).<br/><br/>Basking Shark tourism is managed in some locations but if sustainable tourism industries are indeed to be developed around encounters with these sharks, they should be legislated, continuously monitored, and enforced with permitting systems to make sure operators and tourists are adhering to best practice protocols and codes of conduct.</p>    <p></p>","",,false,false,Global

3155348,10030,Hexanchus griseus,Near Threatened,,2009,2005-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on the information published in the 2005 shark status survey (Fowler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (<em>Hexanchus griseus</em>) is wide ranging, although patchily distributed, in boreal, temperate and tropical seas. It is a deep-benthic, littoral and semipelagic shark, not known to be epipelagic. Young are often found close inshore, adults often in deeper water, although adults and subÂ¬adults are known to enter shallow water in bays with adjacent deepwater canyons. In tropical areas it tends not to penetrate coastal waters. Largely caught as a bycatch of other fisheries, this is also a valuable food and sports fish that appears very vulnerable to overfishing, unable to sustain intensive, targeted fisheries for long periods. Some regional populations have been severely depleted, e.g. in the Northeast Pacific. However, population and fisheries data are lacking from many regions.","A capable predator, the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark feeds on a wide variety of animals including other sharks (it is known to attack hooked conspecifics, which it sometimes follows to the surface from depth), skates, rays, chimaeras, dolphinfish, small swordfish and marlins, herring, grenadiers, antimoras (codlings), rockfishes, cod, lingcod, hake, flounders, halibut, turbot, gurnards and anglerfish, as well as many types of invertebrates including squid, crabs, sea cucumbers and shrimp. It also eats carrion and sometimes seals (Ebert 1994). The bluntnose sixgill shark has not been involved in shark bite incidents on humans, but has been known to swim up to and examine divers (off southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada) and rarely surfers (Cannon Beach, Oregon, USA) without threat or physical contact (C. Bond pers. comm. 1985). Small specimens thrash and snap when captured, but large individuals offer little resistance. This shark appears to become increasingly sensitive to light with increasing size. Adults may become highly agitated when exposed to even moderately intense light. However, this phenomenon needs much more investigation, since the species has been observed and/or photographed from research submersibles off Bermuda and California in well-lighted situations (floodlights) without undue agitation or avoidance of lighted areas (B. Lea pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species is ovoviviparous, bearing very large litters numbering from 22-108 young, size at birth 65-74 cm. Males mature at about 315 cm and females at about 420 cm. Longevity, pupping interval and mating behaviour are unknown. Pupping grounds apparently occur on the upper slopes and outer continental shelves. Since this species preys on conspecifics opportunistically, some mechanism of separation of larger and smaller individuals undoubtedly occurs (Ebert 1994). Young tend to be found in shallow waters often just off the shore, but as they grow they move into successively deeper waters. Adults tend to follow diurnal patterns of vertical distribution, sitting deep on the bottom by day and coming toward or to the surface at night to feed. As for many species of deep-water sharks, it is unknown whether this species segregates by sex.","Due to its broad depth range and relative sluggishness, this shark has often been captured incidentally in fisheries for other species. It is taken by handline, longline, gillnet, traps, trammel net, and both pelagic and bottom-trawls. When captured it is often smoked in the Pacific Northwest U.S. (Washington State) and Italy to produce a fine cured product, usually for export to European markets. It is occasionally used for meat and liver oil in Australia (Last and Stevens 1994). Additionally, it has been used for salted and dried food products, as well as fish meal and pet foods. Uses of fins may exist but are unreported. This species has been sought for sport fisheries in deeper parts of San Francisco Bay, California, USA (beneath the Golden Gate Bridge), as well as in deeper bays of Oregon and Washington States (Compagno in prep. a). This species is widely believed not to be capable of sustaining either sport or commercial fisheries efforts. Attempts to develop directed fisheries for the bluntnose sixgill shark have rapidly collapsed in California waters, usually lasting less than three years (Compagno in prep. a). Attempts to manage the sport fishery for the hexanchids in San Francisco Bay have been hampered by unusual rules that did not regulate the catch of these sharks per boat, but rather set the quotas at fish per person-pole. It has not been uncommon to see boats on the Bay loaded ""to the gunwales"" with fishermen to justify the number of poles aboard. The sixgill shark population in San Francisco and Humboldt Bays of California and Puget Sound complex of Washington was considered to be in serious decline in 1995 as a result of fishery activity. Development of a fishery for bluntnose sixgill in British Columbia is being explored, as a replacement for other traditional bony fish and elasmobranch fisheries that are now in decline. This has proceeded despite strong concerns voiced by fishery biologists as to the unsustainability of such fisheries historically (K. Wolf pers. comm.).",,Unknown,"This species is widely but disjunctly distributed in temperate and tropical seas of the continental and insular shelves of the Pacific, Atlantic (including the type locality in the Mediterranean Sea) and Indian Oceans.

3292503,11534,Lepidochelys olivacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment procedure</span><br/>In accordance with the IUCN guidelines for Red List Assessments, the focus of this evaluation has been the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001). For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the worldâs rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between MÃ©xico to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- BriseÃ±o-DueÃ±as (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in MÃ©xico by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessmentâs requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they havenât recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in MÃ©xico) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (MÃ¡rquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in MÃ©xico about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (MÃ©xico) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the speciesâ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla CaÃ±a, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (MÃ¡rquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adultsâ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20Â°C isotherms (MÃ¡rquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30Â°N to 15Â°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140Â°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or âsolitaryâ with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100â110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; MÃ¡rquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From MÃ©xico to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of MÃ©xico (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (ThomÃ© <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal MÃ©xico to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in MÃ©xico (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the worldâs largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, MÃ©xico where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (MÃ¡rquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (LÃ³pez-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookeryâs decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the âaverage age of parentsâ (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the speciesâ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean â eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean â eastern, western; Pacific Ocean â eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the speciesâ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridleyâs range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the speciesâ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented. The impact from the increasing development of much of the range stateâs coastline has to be evaluated and suitable mitigation measures implemented.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The median and mean rate of change across the 62 assessed populations indicate an expanding global population (9.0 and 72.4 % increase, respectively, over the past three generations), thus there is no evidence of risk to the species under Red List A2 criterion.

Similarly, at 1.9 million kmÂ² of current occupancy (freshwater basin area), there is no evidence of threat under criterion B2 (Table 1). Approximately 7% of the historical range of Sockeye Salmon has been lost due to localized extinction events, but we conclude the species is not threatened globally.<br/><br/>For all Figures, Tables and more details about the methods used for this assessment, see the Supplementary Material.","The species exhibits a great variety of life history patterns. It has a life history form called âKokaneeâ that lives its entire life within freshwater, but this assessment includes only anadromous populations commonly referred to as âSockeyeâ or âRed Salmonâ. Sockeye are born in gravel nests in rivers or lakes and the majority of life history forms rear as juveniles for one to three years in freshwater before migrating to the ocean. Some Sockeye assume a river-type life history and rear in a river channel, while others are lake-type and rear in a lake environment. Primary prey during this life history stage include zooplankton and stream invertebrates. Some sea-type populations migrate within one to three months following emergence, and these make extensive use of estuaries. Most populations spend one to three years in offshore feeding areas where they grow to maturity (ca. 50-60 cm total length, 2.5-3.0 kg weight). Diet in the ocean consists primarily of zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids), but their diet also includes squids and fishes. Natural predators during this period in their life history include Salmon Sharks (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) and Daggertooth (<em>Anotopterus nikparini</em>). Foraging individuals mix among populations both within and between Asia and North America, but at maturity they all migrate back toward their natal freshwater habitat where they spawn and die. The return to natal habitat and the isolation of spawning populations results in considerable genetic differentiation and adaptation to local conditions. Many fish are intercepted by fishers during the homeward, spawning migration, and natural predators include seals, sea lions and bears. Spawning occurs in late summer and autumn, in lake outlet or lake tributary streams or along lake beaches in finer sediments where subterranean upwelling occurs or among boulders on wave-aerated shores. River-type Sockeye spawn in river channels not associated with lakes. Adults display bright red bodies and green heads. Males compete with each other for access to females. Females compete with each other for gravel sites where they build nests, deposit eggs (fecundity typically ranges from 2,000â5,000 eggs), and briefly guard the redd. Median population size for the species is <em>ca</em>. 6,000 individuals. Reviews of life history and ecology of the species appear in Smith <em>et al</em>. (1987), Burgner (1991), Wood (1995) and Quinn (2005).","<strong></strong>The key threats to the species identified by the IUCN SSC Salmon Specialist Group were: <br/><ol><li>Mixed stock fishing leading to over fishing small, less productive populations</li><li>Changing river and ocean conditions that are likely linked to global climate change, expressed in poor marine survival rates and increased incidence of disease in adult spawners</li><li>Negative effects of hatcheries and construction of artificial spawning habitat </li></ol>It is important to note that in many cases, the causes for declines in some specific Sockeye Salmon subpopulations remain unknown.","At the species level, the population is believed to be stable; however, some subpopulations are declining.

This occurs primarily in the Russian portion of their natural range, and the fishery is illegal and the take is unreported.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"1. Many subpopulations of Sockeye in British Columbia were found to be threatened based on this assessment. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for salmon management and is currently formulating conservation units (Holtby and Ciruna, unpublished manuscript) and initiating new policy (e.g,. Wild Salmon Policy) and procedures to stem the loss in diversity (DFO 2005, Irvine and Fraser 2008). Two locations of Sockeye Salmon, Sakinaw Lake and Cultus Lake, have been assessed and listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). However, the federal government has declined protection under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) due to the social and economic costs of closures to the fishery (Irvine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). We encourage COSEWIC and DFO to focus attention on those subpopulations that we identified as threatened in this IUCN assessment.<br/><br/>2. We considered Ozette Lake, Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake Sockeye Salmon as individual spawning sites in a larger subpopulation (SEASONAL UPWELLING). These lake systems are recognized individually as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The latter two sites were not included in the genetic baseline applied in this assessment, thus we assumed all sites are members of a larger, parent subpopulation. Further, we did not include Ozette Lake in our assessment given the recent escapement data available for the native beach-spawning population at that location is obscured by repeated attempts at establishing a tributary spawning population originating from broodstock taken from outside the basin. We encourage efforts at expanding the range-wide microsatellite-DNA baseline to include Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake, and to investigate the status of the native beach-spawning Sockeye in Ozette Lake.<br/><br/>3. Most of the data used in our assessment, particularly in Alaska, were from large aggregate stocks that may contain many (sometimes 100s) of individual spawning sites, and hence may mask important dynamics occurring at small scales. While a number of recent studies have shown that there is a significant degree of coherence among populations within a given region, it is important to acknowledge that a majority of the variability in vital rates are not explained by regional, environmental drivers, and may result from localized threats, for example road or other infrastructural development, or by different life history characteristics which affect productivity. Where possible and feasible, we recommend a more comprehensive monitoring approach that addresses dynamics at the scale of individual spawning sites. An excellent example of this approach is the Wood River system in Alaskaâs Bristol Bay region, where a combination of sampling approaches provides a more integrated monitoring system that translates into a robust assessment of the status of the species in that basin.<br/><br/>4. Mixed-stock fishing is likely to be a key factor in the decline observed at many sites and subpopulations in our assessment. We feel a key priority is filling a gap in knowledge about composition of mixed-stock harvest in coastal Sockeye Salmon fisheries. While a great deal of resources has been invested in developing weak-stock management for Fraser River Sockeye Salmon through the Pacific Salmon Commission and DFO, there has been much less attention placed in other regions along the west coast of North America, particularly in the regions where we found the greatest diversity of subpopulations. We encourage continued investment in developing methods and protocols to account for subpopulation composition of coastal fisheries targeting Sockeye salmon to help track harvest pressure at a biologically and ecologically meaningful scale. Further, we encourage fisheries management agencies to explore restructuring fisheries in a way that would result in shifting fishing pressure from coastal regions to more terminal locations, thus providing a more effective means of controlling fishing pressure at the scale of individual subpopulations.<br/><br/>5. Another leading factor threatening Sockeye Salmon are poor marine survival rates. This has been documented in cases where smolt-to-adult survival rates are estimated through intensive monitoring programs. This appears to be a significant factor explaining declines in adult abundance across many locations in the southern range of the species in North America. While marine conditions have been shown to cycle based on climate forcing and may, in fact, improve in future years, we feel it is important for those managing salmon in this region to acknowledge that poor marine survival may persist, particularly given projections based on global climate change. Reversing declining trends in those subpopulations affected may require increased attention to agents of mortality that are occurring at other life history stages over which we have more local control.<br/><br/>6. Many previous attempts at re-introductions of Sockeye Salmon have been unsuccessful, and we feel any effort at captive breeding or inter-basin transfers for reintroduction purposes should proceed with great caution. These efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild. The lack of success from the captive breeding of endangered Sakinaw Sockeye Salmon by DFO, and endangered Redfish Lake Sockeye by NMFS, are examples of the limitations to these expensive measures. Recent evidence of re-establishment of anadromous runs of Sockeye from remnant, isolated Kokanee populations following dam removal or modification (e.g., Allouette Lake in British Columbia) may offer hope in re-establishing anadromous life histories in cases where dams have prevented passage.<br/><br/>7. Enhancement activities (particularly hatchery releases and spawning channel construction) is likely to be a key factor in reducing abundance in neighbouring, small wild populations. In our assessment, we were unable to functionally track both wild and enhanced Sockeye Salmon where they intermingle. We strongly recommend adoption of integrated monitoring programs that includes a robust marking program and monitoring efforts targeted toward wild Sockeye Salmon populations that would provide the data necessary to address the degree to which enhancement practices threaten wild Sockeye Salmon. It is important to note that two large basins in our assessment (Fraser and Skeena) are all strongly. influenced by enhancement activities, and these activities likely represent a key factor threatening many neighbouring subpopulations.<br/><br/>8. While not addressed in the present assessment due to lack of data, we feel there should be more focused research attention on sea-and river-type Sockeye that may serve as colonizers in the future. This line of research is particularly important given expected habitat alterations from climate change.<br/>&#160;<br/>9. Very few data were available to assess population viability of Sockeye Salmon in the Russian Far East, and we document a significant reduction in escapement in recent years at a site within the Kamchatka River basin that warranted an endangered listing for this subpopulation. The leading threat recognized for this subpopulation is overfishing. The situation has been exacerbated by an increase in illegal fishing practices. We encourage the leading agencies in this region to provide more open access to data, and supporting meta-data, for assessment purposes. We also encourage development of new monitoring efforts throughout the region and increased enforcement to reduce poaching. Many populations of river-type Sockeye exist, particularly in western Kamchatka, and focused research on these populations will provide important insight into the status of the species there.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In areas where it is found, it can be locally abundant so long as the habitat is not overly degraded. Although there are declines in its catch per unit effort, there are measures in place to reduce fishing pressure and, with a rapid breeding succession, this species is able to recover quickly.","This species inhabits deep pools of clear, flowing rivers (Merrick and Lambert 1991, Mosig 1998, Wingfield 1998). They are more commonly seen on sandy stretches with shelter (snags and rocks). Whilst it has a higher tolerance for more saline waters than <em>Cherax destructor</em> and <em>Cherax quadricarinatus</em> (likely due to the naturally high salinity of Western Australia rivers), it is not tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations (Bryant and Papas 2007). It has an optimal water temperature of between 17.5Â°C and 24.5Â°C (Bryant and Papas 2007).

Biomass estimates are increasing in the western Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, and have decreased in other areas in the eastern Pacific. Greater depths that are not currently fished may provide some refuge for adult Pacific sleeper sharks. The lack of life history data (e.g. growth rates and fecundity) and robust population assessment information provide justification for a Data Deficient listing.","A boreal and temperate shark found over continental shelves and slopes. At high latitudes with cold surface waters it ranges into the littoral and even the intertidal (one large individual was found trapped in a tide pool) as well as the surface; however in lower latitudes with temperate water it becomes a deep-water, epibenthic shark, never coming to the surface and ranging down to at least 2,000 m in the extreme southern end of its range (off southern California and Baja California) (Ebert 2003).<br/><br/>Archived depth data from recent tagging studies in the Northeast Pacific showed some sleeper sharks regularly ascended and descended at rates over 200 meters per hour, traveling below the photic zone during the day and approaching the surface at night (Hulbert <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Development is yolk-sac viviparity, but pregnant females have yet to be found, and for some reason are rare, as in the closely related Greenland shark (<em>S. microcephalus</em>).

Although female sharks with ovaries containing over 300 large unfertilized eggs and many small undeveloped ova have been captured in trawls off Moss Landing and Trinidad, California (Gotshall and Jow 1965, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 1987). Size at birth is between 40â65 cm TL suggesting that fecundity may indeed be high for this species given the enormous size of the females.

It is not known if seals and fast-swimming pelagic fish such as salmon are captured alive by these lumbering, sluggish sharks or are picked up as carrion. The small mouths and long heads and oral cavities of these sharks suggest that they are powerful suction feeders, but this has yet to be observed.

Incidental catch in US waters in 2006 was 435 mt, in some years it has reached ~ 1,400 mt (Courtney <em>et al.</em> 2006a, b).<br/><br/>From 1997â2001 in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands area, Pacific sleeper sharks were caught primarily by the Pacific cod longline fishery (30%), walleye pollock pelagic trawl fishery (26%), Greenland turbot longline fishery (17%), flatfish trawl fishery (12%), and sablefish longline fishery (10%). From 1997â2002 in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands area, Pacific sleeper sharks were caught primarily in two statistical areas, which made up 57% and 20% of the total sleeper shark catch. There has been an increasing trend in catch of Pacific sleeper sharks from two statistical areas in the eastern Bering Sea between 1997-2002, however, this may reflect a change in fishing effort as opposed to any increase in the population size.<br/><br/>Fisheries in the western Bering Sea catch mainly juveniles of this species, present at shallower depths than adults. Greater depths that are not currently fished may provide some refuge for adult Pacific sleeper sharks, however the situation should be monitored.","Biomass estimates are available from the results of bottom trawl surveys in the Bering Sea, off the Aleutians and Gulf of Alaska no deeper than 1,000 m (i.e., within upper part of species' bathymetric range, where mainly juvenile Pacific sleeper sharks occur). In Alaska, sharks of 1.5â2.5 m are most common (e.g., Sigler <em>et al</em>. 2006) and sharks as large as 4.3 m have been caught (Orlov 1999). Data from the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea are not robust enough to make statement about population numbers or changes in actual population size. The short-term fluctuations in biomass trend data presented herein are too large to represent trends in overall shark population biomass, but may be a result of sampling vagaries and/or population movements (i.e. changes in local density) rather than actual changes in population size, and could indicate changes in catchability.<br/><br/>Biomass apparently increased in the western Bering Sea from 1,170 mt in 1999 to 87,500 mt in 2002 (Glebov <em>et al.</em> 2003). On the eastern Bering Sea shelf, Pacific sleeper sharks were not well documented in survey catch until the mid-1990s. Biomass in 1999 was estimated at 2,079 mt and increased to 5,602 mt in 2002. However, biomass estimates have decreased since then and were down to 2,944 mt in 2006 (Heifetz <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>On the slope of the eastern Bering Sea no Pacific sleeper sharks were recorded in 1979 or 1981. In 1982 biomass was estimated at 12 mt and increased steadily through 1991 when the estimate was 1,235 mt. A new slope survey initiated in 2002 showed a very large biomass of sleeper sharks (25,445 mt in 2002, but dramatically decreased down to 2,260 mt in 2004 (Heifetz <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>No Pacific Sleeper Sharks were caught off the Aleutians in 1980. In 1983 biomass constituted about 254 mt. Biomass estimates slowly increased through 1991 when biomass was estimated to be 2,927 mt, but then sharply decreased in 1994 to just over 373 mt. Biomass estimates fluctuated from 1997 through 2004 with the highest biomass estimate being 2,638 mt in 2000 and the lowest estimate being 536 mt in 2002. The 2005 biomass estimate increased to 1,017 mt, and subsequently decreased down to 76 mt in 2006 (Heifetz <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, as previously stated above, large short-term biomass fluctuations may be a result of sampling vagaries and/or population movements (i.e. changes in local density) rather than actual changes in population size.<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Alaska biomass in 1984 was estimated as 163 mt. Since then it demonstrates gradual upward trend and reached 57,022 mt in 2005 (Courtney <em>et al.</em> 2006b).",Unknown,"Northwest Pacific to northeast Pacific: Japan along the Kuril Islands, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea (Russia) to the Chukchi Sea and southward to southern California (USA), and Baja California (Mexico) (Ebert, 2003).

In some of the major habitats for harbour porpoises (the shelf waters of the USA and Europe) conservation measures are implemented.","Throughout its range, <em>P. phocoena</em> is largely limited to continental shelf waters. They frequent relatively shallow bays, estuaries, and tidal channels less than about 200 m in depth. Carretta <em>et al</em>. (2001) found that the main distribution of porpoises in northern California was in waters of less than 60 m. Dives to at least 220 m have been recorded via telemetry (BjÃ¸rge and Tolley 2002, Otani <em>et al</em>. 1998). <br/><br/>Harbour porpoises eat a wide variety of fish and cephalopods, and the main prey items vary regionally (see Smith and Gaskin 1974; Recchia and Read 1989, Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 1994, Gonzales <em>et al</em>. 1994, Aarefjord <em>et al</em>. 1995, Gannon <em>et al</em>. 1998, Read, 1999, BÃ¸rjesson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Although small schooling fish (e.g. herring) are important, demersal foraging is characteristic in many areas. <br/><br/>The ecology of Black Sea harbour porpoises may be unusual reflecting the high degree of geographic isolation of their habitat. Low water salinity, seasonal fluctuations of water temperatures and large amounts of anoxic waters below 100-250 m (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>Surveys in 1994 and 2005 in the North Sea and adjacent waters have shown a major shift in distribution from northern to southern areas (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hammond pers. comm.), a change that is reflect by increased in shore-based sightings (Camphuysen 2004, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).","The harbour porpoise has been hunted in many areas of its range, e.g. in Puget Sound, the Bay of Fundy, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Black Sea, and the Danish Belt Seas. Many of these fisheries are now closed, but hunting of harbour porpoises still occurs in Greenland. In Greenland more than 700 per year were taken in 1990-1993 (Teilmann and Dietz 1995). In 2003 the reported catch had increased to 2,320 (NAMMCO 2005). Assessments of population impacts of these takes are not available.<br/><br/>In the Black Sea, large directed takes occurred during 1976-1983. Within that period, the total number of harbour porpoises killed was at least 163,000-211,000. Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans, including harbour porpoises, was banned in 1966 in the former USSR (present Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey. Illegal direct killing of unknown numbers continued in some parts of the Black Sea until 1991 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>Today, the most significant threat in most areas is incidental catches in fishing gear, primarily gill nets. Incidental mortality in fishing gear is likely to occur throughout the range of the species, but substantial incidental takes have been documented (summarized in Donovan and BjÃ¸rge 1995) for the Gulf of Maine (1,200-2,900/year), Bay of Fundy (80-400/year), West Greenland (1,400/year), North Sea (4,600/year) Celtic Shelf (1,500/year), and also off central California during the 1980s and 1990s (tens to hundreds per year; Barlow and Hanan 1995). More recent monitoring programs of Danish set-net fisheries in the North Sea revealed an average of 5,591 porpoises taken annually in the period 1987-2001 (Vinther and Larsen 2002). However, most North Sea gillnet fisheries were not monitored for marine mammal bycatch (ICES 2002).<br/><br/>In the Black Sea incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets is estimated to have been in the thousands annually through the 1980s (e.g., Birkun 2002a). Almost all (99%) of the porpoises are caught in bottom-set gillnets. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in recent times owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Black Sea.<br/><br/>Other types of threats include chemical pollution, vessel traffic, noise, and depletion of prey by overfishing. Due to its near shore distribution, harbour porpoises are exposed to coastal sources of pollution throughout most of its range. Chemical pollution (PCBs) has been described as having adverse effects (see Baltic subpopulation account). <br/><br/>An explosion at a gas-drilling platform in the Azov Sea in August 1982 resulted in the deaths of over 2,000 porpoises (Birkun 2002b).<br/><br/>Severe habitat degradation and prey depletion caused by intensive fishing in the Black Sea, together with explosive growth of populations of invasive species are considered important threats for local harbour porpoises (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Reduced prey availability coincided with two mass mortality events (in 1989 and 1990) that affected all three Black Sea cetacean species, but primarily harbour porpoises (Birkun 2002c). Severe pulmonary nematodosis, caused by <em>Halocercus spp</em>. and complicated by bacterial super-infection, was recognized as a primary cause of the deaths, which were mainly of young animals.","In the North Atlantic Ocean (including the Black and Azov seas), fourteen population units have been proposed (Donovan and BjÃ¸rge 1995), and in the North Pacific, several population units have been identified based on genetic studies (Chivers <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/><br/>There are no synoptic surveys covering the entire range within ocean basins, but abundance has been estimated for selected portions of the range. Abundance estimates have been summarized by Read 1999 (but see updates in Angliss and Outlaw 2005, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2006). About 73,000 animals have been estimated to occur along the west coast of the USA (including 1,656 [CV=0.39] in the Morro Bay population, 1,613 [CV=0.42] in the Monterey Bay population, 8,521 [CV=0.38] from San Francisco to the Russian River, 17,763 [CV=0.39] in northern California and southern Oregon, 39,586 [CV=0.38] in Oregon and Washington, and 3,509 [CV=0.40] in Washington inland waters). In Alaska abundance is estimated at about 89,000 (including 10,947 [CV=0.24] in southeast Alaska, 30,506 [CV=0.21] in the Gulf of Alaska, and 47,356 [CV=0.22] in the Bering Sea) (see summary in Angliss and Outlaw 2005). In the western Atlantic, there are an estimated 75,438 [CV=0.42] in the Gulf of Maine/Upper Bay of Fundy to the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and 27,000 for the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2007). Abundance has been estimated at 27,000 in Iceland (Stenson 2003) and 11,000 [CV=0.44] off North Norway - Barents Sea (BjÃ¸rge and Ãien 1995). In the waters of the European Atlantic, abundance in 2005 was estimated at 385,600 [CV=0.20] (P.S. Hammond pers. comm.), of which about 335,000 [CV=0.21] were estimated in the North Sea and adjacent waters, where abundance was estimated at 341,000 [CV=0.14] in 1994 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2002). The abundance in the Baltic Sea is estimated at 599 (CV = 0.57) (Hiby and Lovell 1996). Line transect surveys have been conducted recently (since 2001) to estimate harbour porpoise abundance in different portions of the Black Sea.

Estimated length at 50% maturity for females is 42 cm (Cayre and Farrugio 1986, Stequert and Ramcharrun 1996).<br/><br/>This species sex ratio is about 1:1 but fisheries that rely on young, immature fish are dominated by females, while those that capture older fish are mostly male. This species spawns several times per season in batches: at sea surface temperatures of 24â29Â°C throughout the year in the Caribbean and other equatorial waters, and from spring to early fall in subtropical waters, with the spawning season becoming shorter as distances from the equator increases (Erdman 1977, Collette 2010). In tropical waters, reproductively active female Skipjack Tuna spawn almost daily. Models of migration have been proposed, especially from the central Pacific into the eastern Pacific. Fecundity increases with size but is highly variable, the number of eggs per season in females 41â87 cm FL ranges from 80,000 to 2,000,000 (Collette 2010).<br/><br/>Maximum Size is 108 cm FL, 32.5â34.5 kg.

They are taken at the surface mostly with purse seines and pole-and-line gear, but is also caught by trolling on light tackle using plugs, spoons, feathers, or strip bait (Collette 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO)</span><br/>In the EPO, this species is primarily caught with purse seines, and with pole and line and long-line to a lesser degree. It is an important game fish in Panama (D'Croz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994). More recently this species is being fished with drifting floating objects. The large increase in catch observed in the past 10 years is primarily due to fishing with fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the equatorial eastern Pacific. There is a continuously increasing exploitation rate in the EPO, but models do not predict widespread population decline (IATTC 2008). Given the reduction in larger predators, it is expected that this species is relatively abundant. However, there is a decreasing average weight and increasing catch effort with no comprehensive stock assessment in this region (STEFC 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO)</span><br/>Although Skipjack Tuna are the most intensively fished species in the central Pacific Ocean, biomass appears to have remained relatively stable between 1952â1998 (Cox <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002). A Japanese pole-and-line fleet previously dominated the fishery, but it is now dominated by purse seiners, and catches by this gear have shown an increasing trend for three decades (ISSF 2010). Over the past five years, the catch has been at record high levels exceeding 1.2 million tonnes annually and accounting for more than 65% of the annual catch of principal tuna species in the region (STECF 2007). In the WCPO, the level of catch is very high, and some boats are not recording catches, and there are difficulties in monitoring the various fleets concerned (STECF 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean</span><br/>In the Indian Ocean this species is mainly caught by purse seine, gillnet and bait boat (IOTC 2008). The high productivity life history characteristics of Skipjack Tuna suggest this species is resilient and not prone to overfishing, and the stock status indicators suggest there is no need for immediate concern about the status of Skipjack Tuna. However, it is clear that catches cannot grow at the current rate indefinitely (STECF 2007). The effect of FAD fishery on juveniles of other tuna species should be strictly monitored and evaluated.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The numerous changes that have occurred in the Skipjack Tuna fishery since the early 1990s (such as the use of FADs and the expansion of the fishing area towards the west) that have brought about an increase in Skipjack Tuna catchability and in the proportion of the stock that is exploited. At present, the major fisheries are the purse seine fisheries, particularly those of Spain, France, Cape Verde, Guatemala and Ghana, followed by baitboat fisheries of Ghana, Spain and France. Increasing harvests and fishing effort could lead to involuntary consequences for other species that are harvested in combination with Skipjack Tuna. In the West Atlantic, the major fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet (STECF 2009). The Brazilian bait boat fleet of Santa Catarina State yields almost half of the Skipjack Tuna catches in the West Atlantic (Andrade and Kinas 2004).With respect to the West Atlantic, the fishing effort of the Brazilian baitboats seems to be stable over the last 20 years.&#160; There has been a recent increase in Skipjack Tuna catchability from 1â13% per year since the early 1980s. The change in the selectivity pattern observed for the purse seine fishery suggests that this fleet is mainly targeting juvenile tunas (ICCAT 2008). In the insular Caribbean, this species is important to the artisanal fishery (Mahon 1996).

Landings data have been relatively constant over the last 20 years, and between 35,000 and 100,000 tonnes. In general, the Skipjack Tuna global population in the EPO has been high for the last 30 years perhaps related to increased frequency of El-NiÃ±o events. Therefore, the general eastward expansion of the Skipjack habitat predicted in this simulation is very plausible (Loukos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Worm and Tittensor 2011).<br/><br/>The last full assessment for Skipjack Tuna in the EPO was in 2005 (Maunder and Harley 2005), although an evaluation of a set of fishery indicators was given in 2008 (Maunder 2010). Reported landings from 1976â2005 (IATTC 2008) varied from 52,000â311,000 metric tonnes per year in the Eastern Pacific including California. The recruitment of tuna to the tropical eastern Pacific region is highly variable and is thought to be the reason for the large variations in stock size. The average weight of this species has been declining since 2000, and the 2007 average weight is approaching the lower reference level. The biomass, recruitment, and exploitation rate has also been increasing over the past 20 years. The main concern with this species' stock is the constantly increasing exploitation rate. However, the data- and model-based indicators have yet to detect any adverse consequence of this increase. There have been observed declines in average weight, and average weight is near its lower reference level, which can be a consequence of overexploitation, but it can also be caused by recent recruitments being stronger than past recruitments (IATTC 2008, Maunder 2010). For example, a group of relatively strong cohorts entered the fishery in 2000â2003.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO)</span><br/>Within the equatorial region, fishing mortality increased throughout the modelled period (1952â2007) and is estimated to be highest in the western region in the most recent years. The impact of fishing is predicted to have reduced recent biomass by about 40% in the western equatorial region and 20% in the eastern region (Langley and Hampton 2008). However, this most recent assessment for Skipjack Tuna in the WCPO (Langeley and Hampton 2008) concluded that the stock was not in an overfished state nor was overfishing occurring. Nothing has been observed in the fishery that indicates that this conclusion should be changed, although some mild concern over possible shifts in distribution of Skipjack Tuna in the northern regions of the WCPO has been expressed (Joseph 2009, ISSF 2010).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean</span><br/>An attempt was made in 2003 to assess the stock status but due to the large uncertainties in the information needed to conduct a complete assessment, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) only analysed different fishery indicators that could provide a general understanding of the state of the stock (i.e., trends in catches and nominal catch per unit effort (CPUE), average weight in the catches, length-based cohort analysis (IOTC 2008, IOTC 2009, STECF 2007). In spite of not having a full stock assessment for this species, the analysis did not show reasons for concern, as catches have continued to increase as effort increased and the majority of the catch comes from fish that are already sexually mature (greater than 40 cm), as the fishing pattern by size indicates. However, length-based cohort analyses indicated a growing catch of smaller size fish due to the fishery with fish aggregating devices (FADs) (STECF 2007).<br/><br/>Preliminary data indicate that catches in 2007 may be the lowest since 2002 (IOTC 2009), possibly due to the lack of fishing in areas patrolled by pirates. However, the range of stock indicators available does not currently signal any problems in the fishery, and catches have continued to increase as effort increased (IOTC 2009, STECF 2009). Furthermore, the majority of the catch comes from fish that are sexually mature (greater than 40 cm) and therefore likely to have already reproduced (STECF 2009). The IOTC has recommended that this species should be carefully monitored given current fishing pressure as it is clear that current catches cannot be increased indefinitely (IOTC 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The Atlantic population is divided into eastern and western stocks; with the eastern stock contributing the majority of catches (~ 80%). Stock assessments for eastern and western Atlantic Skipjack Tuna were conducted in 2008 using available catches to 2006 (STECF 2009). In summary, it appears that both stocks in the Atlantic are currently being fished at levels below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), and the stocks are not being overfished, and are not considered to be in an overfished state (ISSF 2010). The total catches obtained in 2008 in the entire Atlantic Ocean were close to 149,000 t which represents the catch average of the last five years (STECF 2009). This species is not abundant in the Mediterranean with FAO reported landings fluctuating around 100 t from 1996â2005. Although catch is slowly increasing in the Mediterranean in recent years, statistics in the Mediterranean are incomplete (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Atlantic, the preliminary estimates of catches made in 2008 amounted to 127,000 t, representing an increase of 3% as compared to the average of 2003â2007. A Bayesian method, using only catch information estimated the MSY (under a Schaefer-type model parametrisation) at 143,000â156,000 t, a result which agrees with the estimate obtained by the modified Grainger and Garcia approach: 149,000 t. In addition, two non-equilibrium surplus biomass production models were applied for eight time series of CPUEs, and for a combined CPUE index weighted by fishing areas. In general, the range of plausible MSY values estimated from these models (155,000â170,000 t) were larger than in the Bayesian model based on catches. It is therefore difficult to estimate MSY under the continuous increasing conditions of the exploitation plot of this fishery (one-way of the trajectory to substantially weaker effort values) and which as a result, the potential range distribution of some priors needs to be constrained (e.g., for growth rate, or for the shape parameter of the generalized model) (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009). Although there are discrepancies among various models that create difficulty in estimating MSY, it is unlikely that Skipjack Tuna is over exploited in the eastern Atlantic (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009).<br/><br/>In the Western Atlantic, the major fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009). Catches in 2008 in the West Atlantic amounted to 22,000 t representing a decrease of 17% as compared to the trend observed for recent years. Catch only model estimated MSY at around 30,000 t (similar to the estimate provided by the Grainger and Garcia approach) and the Bayesian surplus model (Schaefer formulation) at 34,000 t. Other analyses using Multifan-CL indicated MSY convergens to about 31,000â36,000 t. For the western Atlantic stock, in light of the information provided by the trajectories of B/BMSY and F/FMSY, it is unlikely that the current catch is larger than the current replacement yield (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009).",Stable,"This species is circumglobal in seas warmer than 15Â°C.

The closures can be for either of two periods, AugustâSeptember or NovemberâJanuary (ISSF 2010). Skipjack Tuna is a notoriously difficult species to assess. Due to Skipjackâs high and variable productivity (i.e., annual recruitment is a large proportion of total biomass), it is difficult to detect the effect of fishing on the population with standard fisheries data and stock assessment methods. This is particularly true for the stock of the EPO, due to the lack of age-frequency data and the limited tagging data. One of the major problems mentioned above is the uncertainty as to whether the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the purse seine fisheries is an appropriate index of abundance for Skipjack Tuna, particularly when the fish are associated with fish-aggregating devices (FADs). Purse seine CPUE data are particularly problematic, because it is difficult to identify the appropriate unit of effort (Maunder 2010). Since the stock assessments and reference points for Skipjack Tuna in the EPO are so uncertain, developing alternative methods to assess and manage the species that are robust to these uncertainties would be beneficial.<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, there is currently no specific regulation in effect for Skipjack Tuna. However, with the aim of protecting juvenile Bigeye Tuna, the French and the Spanish boat owners voluntarily decided to apply a moratorium for fishing under floating objects between November and the end of January for the 1997â1998 and 1998â1999 periods. ICCAT implemented a similar moratorium from 1999 to January 2005. This moratorium has had an effect on Skipjack Tuna catches made with FADs. On the basis of a comparison of average catches between 1993â1996, prior to the moratoria, and those between the 1998â2002 period, the average Skipjack Tuna catches between November and January for the purse seine fleets that applied the moratoria, were reduced by 64%. During that period (1998â2002), the average annual Skipjack Tuna catches by purse seine fleets that applied the moratoria decreased by 41% (42,000 t per year). However, this decrease is possibly a combined result of the decrease in effort and the impact of the moratoria (the average annual catch per boat decreased only 18% between these two periods). This moratorium area was reduced significantly in spatial and temporal coverage in 2001. The ICCAT-SCRS recommends that catches not be allowed to exceed MSY (ISSF 2010, STECF 2009).<br/><br/>In the Western and Central Pacific, there is a limit on the use of FADs and purse seiners, and to reduce the catch of long liners to reduce bycatch for Bigeye Tuna, all of which may have positive conservation effects for this species.","",,false,false,Global

Generation time is estimated to be around 3â4 years.<br/><br/>Maximum Size is 102 cm fork length (FL). The all-tackle game fish record is of a 9.67 kg fish caught at 181 Spot off California (IGFA 2011).","<p>This species is important in minor commercial fisheries. It is harvested in the USA and Mexico, primarily using purse seines, and is also important in sport fisheries in California. Targeting of this species off California occurs primarily off San Pedro with smaller purse seine boats, with consistent effort. Total catch of all three populations of bonitos (including <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. orientalis</span>) in the eastern tropical Pacific was reported by Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) as 10,000 metric tons, dropping to 300â2,600 mt in 2000â2005, and then increasing to 17,000 mt in 2007 (IATTC 2008).<br/></p>","The northern subspecies, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis lineolata</span>, is a component of the commercial purse seine fishery as well as a popular recreational fish in southern California. Catch landings for this subspecies have greatly fluctuated, and therefore it is difficult to estimate the effect of fishing on its population. It is not clear what is causing these fluctuations. Pacific Bonito populations fluctuate on a decadal scale in a similar manner as the northern anchovy. Current conditions indicate that the eastern Pacific is in a warm water regime that favours Pacific Sardine over Northern Anchovy, which is a primary prey species for Pacific Bonito. It is therefore thought that these fluctuations in both anchovy and Pacific Bonito are associated with warm and cold water periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>Commercial landings for this subspecies have declined steadily since the mid 1980s, but have increased moderately in recent years, from 291 metric tons in 1997 to 803 metric tons in 2008. The trend over the last 15 years seems to be low landings for most years interspersed with high yield years. Competition with higher valued fisheries was likely part of the decline observed in landings during the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, increased regulation, decreased stocks and lower market demand likely contributed to the decline. In 1982, Mexico began restricting foreign vessel access to its near-shore fisheries. Prior to this closure, 50â90% of Pacific Bonito landed in the United States was caught off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. Now less than 10% originates in Mexican waters (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>FAO reported landings for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis</span> (both subspecies) highly fluctuate and range from 35,016 tonnes reported in 1950 to 11,3161 tonnes in 1961; to 2,383 tonnes reported in 2003 and 6,243 tonnes reported in 2006 (FAO 2009). Landings in California and Mexico have fluctuated greatly over the past 50 years from less than 1,000 metric tons to nearly 14,000 mt in the early 1970s (worth $1,222,000 in total California landings in 1976) (Collette and Nauen 1983). Combined landings of U.S. and Mexico in 1995 was about 6,800 mt, while in the last five years (2000â2005), the landings have been under 500 mt (FAO 2009), representing a decline of over 90%, assuming landings are a good proxy for population trends.<br/><br/>The combined Chilean and Peruvian landings of the southern subspecies, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis chiliensis</span>, went from almost zero in 1,940 mt to a peak of around 110,000 mt in 1961 and dropped off to about 40,000 mt in 1973 (Collette and Nauen, 1983). From 1995â2005 the catch reduction went from around 30,000 mt per year to around 1,000 to 5,000 mt per year (FAO 2009). Reported landings for this species (in Ecuador, Chile and Peru) plunged to between 1,000 and 5,000 mt per year between 1998 and 2005. A conservative estimate is a reduction in catch of around 80% since 1995.<br/><br/>In Peru, however, there was a decrease in effort during the late 1990s which may reflect the decrease in catch at this time. Also drops in catch may be related to reduction in anchovies, but also during this time there was an increase in effort for Jack Mackerel and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Scomber japonicus</span>. Although the catch is rising again in 2005 and 2006, this is likely due to an increase in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Chile, less than 10,000 mt in the 1960 and 1970s was estimated to be caught, and this was the period of the highest catches (R. Sierra pers. comm. 2008). FAO data for catches from Chile are not necessarily correct for this species, especially in the 1980s.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific, landings data are combined for two bonito species, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. orientalis</span> and both subspecies of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. chiliensis</span> (IATTC 2008). The maximum catch was 14,000 metric tonnes in 1977 and 1990. After 1999 the total catch dropped from thousands metric tonnes to under 1,000 metric tonnes per year with a minimum of 43 in 2003, but may be increasing again as 3,600 tonnes was reported in 2006 (IATTC 2008). It is most likely that the majority of these landings data are for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. chiliensis chiliensis</span>, as the majority of the catch was from Chile and Peru.",Decreasing,"<p>Pacific Bonito are endemic to the Eastern Pacific and are divided into two geographically distinct populations. The California fishery targets the northern subspecies, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis lineolata</span>, which ranges from the Gulf of Alaska to the Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico. This population is centred between southern California and central Baja California, Mexico and moves farther north in warm water years.

Currently, only California statues and regulations apply to the take of this species. If there is an increase in take of Pacific Bonito, its status could be changed to actively managed. It is legal to target Pacific bonito commercially and recreationally year round (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>After the last population assessment in 1982, a minimum size limit of 24 inches (61 cm) or five pounds (2.3 kg) was instituted for both commercial and recreational fisheries. In the recreational fishery there is a ten fish bag limit and up to five undersized fish can be retained. Commercial vessels fishing with round haul gear (e.g., purse seine, lampara net) may retain 18 or less by number of undersized fish. When using gill or trammel nets, only 1,000 pound (454 kg) or less of undersized Pacific bonito may be retained (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>The minimum size for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. chiliensis lineolata</span> in Peru is 52 cm FL with a maximum tolerance of juveniles od 10% of the catch.

This species also has a very large range. As with other beaked whales, threats that could cause widespread declines include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and seismic surveys, and bycatch. The combination of the large global range and relatively high abundance with possible declines driven by more localized threats is believed sufficient to rule out a 30% global reduction over three generations (criterion A).","Although Cuvierâs beaked whales can be found nearly anywhere in deep (&gt;200 m) waters, they seem to prefer waters near the continental slope, especially those with a steep sea bottom. Off Japan, whaling records indicate that <em>Z. cavirostris</em> is most commonly found in waters deeper than 1,000 m (Heyning 1989). The species is known around many oceanic islands, and in some enclosed seas. It is rarely found close to mainland shores, except in submarine canyons or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and coastal waters are deep (Heyning 1989, 2002) and is mostly a pelagic species that appears to be confined by the 10Â°C isotherm and the 1,000 m bathymetric contour (Houston 1991; Robineau and di Natale 1995).<br/><br/>Cuvier's beaked whales, like all beaked whales, appear to prefer deep waters for feeding. Dives of up to 40 minutes have been documented. Although few stomach contents have been examined, they appear to feed mostly on deep-sea squid, but also sometimes take fish and some crustaceans (MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2003). They apparently feed both near the bottom and in the water column. As with other beaked whales, suction appears to be used to draw prey items into the mouth at close range (Heyning and Mead 1996).","There is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005; Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006; Polacheck 2006) and over-fishing and collapse of several important âpreyâ fish stocks world-wide (e.g., Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The effects of such fish population reductions and subsequent ecosystem changes on world-wide populations these whales are unknown but could result in population declines. <br/> <br/>Never the main target of commercial whalers, Cuvierâs beaked whales have sometimes been taken as bycatch in other direct fisheries, such as those in the Caribbean islands, Indonesia, Taiwan, Peru, and Chile (Heyning 1989; Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the Japanese <em>Berardius</em> fishery, <em>Z. cavirostris</em> have been taken on an opportunistic basis, with catches varying from 3 to 35 animals taken yearly (Omura and Kimura 1955). Although the <em>Berardius</em> fishery still continues, there have been no direct takes of <em>Z. cavirostris</em> in recent years (Nishiwaki and Oguro 1972).<br/> <br/>Mignucci-Giannoni <em>et al</em>. (1999) conducted an assessment of cetacean strandings in waters off Puerto Rico, the United States and the British Virgin Islands to identify the factors associated with reported mortality events between 1867 and 1995. The most common human-related cause categories observed were entanglement and accidental captures, followed by animals being shot or speared. <br/><br/>Bycatch of Cuvierâs beaked whales has been reported in several fisheries. Julian and Beeson (1998) report a mortality of 22-44 individuals per year in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery from 1992 to 1995. Mora Pinto <em>et al</em>. (1995) report on bycatches from Colombian fisheries. Notarbartolo di Sciara (1990) reported on bycatch in the Italian swordfish fishery. Bycatch in the western North Atlantic is very low, with one animal reported between 1994 and 1998 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); this species may also be at risk.<br/><br/>In recent years, there has been increasing concern that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, may be harmful to beaked whales (Malakoff 2002). The use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in a number of mass strandings of Cuvierâs beaked whales, including in the Mediterranean Sea during 1996 (Frantzis 1998), the Bahamas during 2000 (Balcomb and Claridge 2001), the Madeira Islands in 2000 (Frietas 2004) and the Canary Islands in 2002 (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003). Mass strandings of Cuvierâs beaked whales in Japan also appear to be correlated with locations of naval exercises (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2006). A stranding of two Cuvierâs beaked whales in the Gulf of California was closely correlated with a seismic survey (Malakoff 2002). <br/><br/>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).","Global abundance has not been estimated for Cuvierâs beaked whales, but abundance has been estimated for several study areas. Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated an abundance of about 20,000 (CV=27%) Cuvierâs beaked whales in the eastern tropical Pacific, but a re-analysis of the same data increased that to about 80,000 after accounting for diving animals that were missed (Ferguson and Barlow 2001). Other dive-corrected estimates of Cuvierâs beaked whale abundance include 1,884 (CV=68%) off the U.S. west coast (Barlow 2003) and 15,242 (CV=143%) in Hawaiian waters (Barlow 2006). Cuvierâs beaked whales are undoubtedly among the most common and abundant of all the beaked whales, and worldwide abundance is likely to be well over 100,000. There is no information on trends in the global abundance of this species.<br/><br/>This is the only widely-distributed beaked whale species for which a global assessment of genetic diversity has been conducted. The results of this study suggest that there is probably little movement of Cuvierâs beaked whales among different ocean basins, and that there may even be a distinct subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"Cuvier's beaked whales may have the most extensive range of any beaked whale species (Heyning 1989, 2002). They are widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions in both hemispheres. Their range covers most marine waters of the world, with the exception of shallow water areas, and very high-latitude polar regions. They are found in many enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk (but not in the Baltic or Black Seas).

It is not believed to be uncommon but it is potentially vulnerable to low-level threats and a 30% global reduction over three generations (81 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out (criterion A).,"Though they may be seen close to shore where deep water approaches the coast, Baird's beaked whales' primary habitats appear to be over or near the continental slope and near oceanic seamounts (Kasuya 2002) in temperate oceanic waters 1,000 to 3,000 m deep. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, these whales have been recorded in waters ranging between 23Â°C and 29Â°C, with a southern limit lying at the 15Â°C isotherm at a depth of 100 m. In the northern Okhotsk Sea the species has been recorded in waters less than 500 m deep, which could be explained by the availability of prey species in shallower waters at higher latitudes (Reyes 1991). <br/><br/>Baird's beaked whales feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Balcomb 1989; Kasuya 2002), as well as some pelagic fish, such as mackerel, sardines, and saury. The diet off the Pacific coast of Japan consists of 82% fish and 18% cephalopods, while in the southern Sea of Okhotsk the proportions are 13% and 87%, respectively. They may do much of their feeding at depths of 800-1,200 m.","Bairdâs beaked whales are one of the few species of ziphiids to be commercially hunted (Kasuya 2002; Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984). Small numbers have been hunted by the Soviets, Canadians and Americans, whereas hunts by Japan have been major. The Japanese fishery started in the early 1600s and underwent several expansions and declines. At its peak, after World War II, over 300 whales were killed annually. Now the industry operates with a quota of 8 for the Sea of Japan, 2 for the southern Okhotsk Sea and 52 for the Pacific coasts (Kasuya 2002). <br/><br/>Incidental catches have been recorded, but are generally not common. Some Baird's beaked whales have been caught in Japanese salmon driftnets (Reeves and Mitchell 1993). <br/><br/>This species, like other beaked whales, is likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration (Cox <em>et al</em>. 2006) <br/><br/>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, given its cool-temperate to sub-polar habitat, although the nature of likely impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).","Three subpopulations of Bairdâs beaked whales are recognized in the western North Pacific (Sea of Japan, Okhotsk Sea, and Pacific Ocean), where these whales have been exploited for centuries. There are an estimated 1,100 Bairdâs beaked whales in the eastern North Pacific, including about 228 (CV=51%) off the US west coast (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2006, Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2006). Abundance in Japanese waters has been estimated at about 7,000 individuals (5,029 off the Pacific coast, 1,260 in the eastern Sea of Japan, and 660 for the southern Okhotsk Sea â Miyashita 1986; Kasuya 2002; Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2006). These are likely underestimates because visual survey methods often do not account for the fact that the whales dive for long periods and are inconspicuous when they surface (Barlow 1999). There is no information on trends in the global abundance of this species.",Unknown,"Baird's beaked whales are found in deep oceanic waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Japan, Okhotsk, and Bering Seas.

In the 2000 IUCN Red List, <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> was listed as Vulnerable globally and Conservation Dependent in Australasia (Stevens 2000). This updated assessment retains the original Vulnerable global assessment (with updated criteria) and presents new regional assessments of this species as Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic, Vulnerable in Australia and South Africa, Near Threatened in New Zealand and Least Concern in the Eastern North Pacific. Further research, monitoring and assessment of status is required for this species in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean, Eastern Central Atlantic and Eastern South Pacific where it is currently considered Data Deficient.  <strong>Australasia</strong> The Australia and New Zealand assessments are based mainly on two pieces of evidence: (1) In southern Australia the current mature biomass has been estimated from age-based model outputs to be below 20% of the level before commercial target fishing began in the 1920s, and; (2) Very low biological productivity; maximum age is potentially 60 years, age at maturity in females exceeds 10 years. In New Zealand, the stock has been managed for 17 years, and landings have been stable for the past decade. However, commercial TACs introduced following some CPUE declines have been regularly exceeded. Fisheries for the species are managed by ITQs in both New Zealand and Australia that should allow stocks to begin to rebuild, but the sustainable catch level in New Zealand remains unknown.  <strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong> In the Southwest Atlantic the <em>G. galeus</em> population is subject to intensive fishing throughout its distribution, drastic declines have occurred yet the population continues to be fished without restraint. The declines have been most marked in Brazil and Uruguay, where the CPUE has declined almost to zero. The species migrates seasonally between wintering grounds in south Brazil and Uruguay and summer grounds off Argentina where the pupping and nursery areas are situated and where intense and directed fishery of gravid females occurs.  In Argentina, where the animals are generally smaller, the CPUE for the trawler fleet has declined by around 80% during the past decade and based on current trends will inevitably collapse within 5 to 10 years. Already considered Critically Endangered, without major and urgent management measures the situation for this species in the Southwest Atlantic is set to become even worse.  <strong>South Africa</strong> In South Africa <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> has been targeted to varying degrees since the 1930s and likely prior to that by indigenous coastal communities.  As the principal target species of the directed South African shark fishery it is likely that the population has been affected. There is evidence of declines from commercial catch data and observations from shark longline fishermen. Also of concern is data from the Gansbaai longline fishery showing a high proportion of the catch to be immature females. Recent estimates based on a spawner biomass per recuit model (therefore must be considered with caution) suggest that biomass of the South Africa population is at 43% of pre-exploitation level (M. McCord 2005). It is possible that the South African population is currently being fully exploited and any increase in fishing pressure may result in a decline of biomass to below 40% of the unexploited level (McCord 2005). The lack of well-designed regulations governing the South African recreational and commercial shark fisheries and lack of bag limits/bycatch limits in other fisheries that take <em>G. galeus</em> means that a hypothetically unlimited fishery exists for that species. Given the life-history characteristics of this species (long generation time, late age at maturity, first age of reproduction) and the knowledge of the state of the fisheries for these sharks elsewhere it is likely that the South African population of <em>G. galeus</em> is highly susceptible to overfishing and the Vulnerable assessment is based on the fact that the current shark fishery is virtually unregulated, declines have apparently already taken place and are predicted for the future. Proposed policy for 2005 indicates that long-term rights for the shark fishery will be allocated and multi-species permits will be revoked and replaced with single-species permits. It is envisaged that demersal longline permits to target soupfin sharks will be restricted in number as will the number of traditional handline vessels permitted to catch traditional linefish (including sharks). This will alter the characteristics of the fishery and it is highly recommended that another stock assessment be completed within 3 to 5 years to evaluate the effect of these changes on the population. As for its range into Namibia and southern Angola; there is no fishery for this species, they may be occasionally caught in trawl fisheries but there is no further information at this time.  <strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong> <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> is of limited importance in commercial fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic where it is typically a bycatch of mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries especially by French vessels fishing in the English Channel, Western Approaches and northern Bay of Biscay. In Europe, this species is important in recreational fisheries. Data is apparently limited, as landings are often included as ""dogfishes and hounds"". Nevertheless, England and France have species-specific landings data and there are also limited data from Denmark and Ireland in recent years. Tope also feature in catch statistics for Portugal and the Azores. Biological data for Northeast Atlantic stocks are limited. Due to lack of data to form the basis of an accurate assessment, the species is considered Data Deficient in the Northeast Atlantic at this time and further investigation into its status there is required.  <strong>Mediterranean</strong> Although there are no target fisheries for <em>G. galeus</em> in the Mediterranean, declines are suspected to have occurred, and it is only rarely seen as bycatch. Overfishing, together with habitat degradation caused by intensive bottom trawling are considered the main factors that have produced the suspected decline of the Mediterranean stock. Due to lack of data to form the basis of an accurate assessment, the species is considered Data Deficient in the Mediterranean.  <strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong> <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> was the mainstay of the shark fishery ""boom"" between 1936 and 1944, when over 24 million pounds were landed. The fishery ended abruptly in 1946 with the development of synthetic vitamin A. Since 1977, the fishery has averaged between 150,000 and 250,000 pounds dressed weight landed annually. Since no studies on this species have taken place in over 50 years in this region, it is unknown whether stocks off California have attained the size of those exploited before the second world war. However while it appeared that the adult stock might have collapsed at that time, there would have been large stocks of juveniles to allow for a population recovery. Since the 1940s there has been no economic incentive to target it and these sharks are now mostly taken at low levels as a bycatch to other commercial species and by recreational anglers. Although there has been no stock assessment for several decades, the fishing mortality can be expected to be low, landings have been relatively stable and given the lack of a concentrated fishery at this time this species is listed as Least Concern for the eastern North Pacific. However, if fishing pressure increases it will be necessary to re-evaluate this assessment.  <strong>Eastern Central Atlantic and Eastern Pacific (off Peru and Chile)</strong> There is currently no information from the Eastern Central Atlantic off West Africa, nor in the Eastern Pacific off Peru and Chile. However, given the evidence of decline and low recovery capacity from other parts of its range, it is imperative that the status of this species is further investigated in these and other regions for which this species is considered Data Deficient, in order to establish appropriate conservation and management measures.","Most abundant in cold to warm temperate continental seas, from the surfline and very shallow water to well offshore (Compagno in prep b). In Australasia <em>G. galeus</em> occurs over the continental shelf from shallow, inshore bays (mainly juveniles) to about 800 m depth on the continental slope. At least in some areas (Northeast Atlantic, Tasman Sea) they also extend offshore up to 1,610 km from the coast (Fitzmaurice 1979, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2000). The species is primarily found near the bottom but ranges through the water column even into the pelagic zone. Similar to the Australian and South American populations, the South African population inhabits cool waters from the coastal surfline to the continental shelf (&gt;400 m). <br/> <br/>The life history parameters of <em>G. galeus</em> varies between regions. For a review of life history from different regions see Walker (1999) which draws on a number of sources including: Ripley (1946), Olsen (1954, 1959, 1984), Freer (1992), Capape and Mellinger (1988) and Peres and Vooren 1991). For a summary of life history characteristics by regional population see the tables at the end of this assessment (these will be specifically drawn upon for regional reports). <br/> <br/>The maximum size varies considerably: the maximum size recorded is ~200 cm total length (female) in the Mediterranean (Capape and Mellinger 1998), but is somewhat smaller in the Southwest Atlantic with a maximum size of 155 cm (female); 148 cm (male) (Peres and Vooren 1991). Differences are also apparent in the size at maturity in different regions. The smallest sizes at sexual maturity are in the Southwest Atlantic where males attain sexual maturity at 107-117 cm and females at 118 to 128 cm (Peres and Vooren 1991), elsewhere the range is generally between 120 and 135 cm for males and 134 to 140 cm for females (Olsen 1954, Capape and Mellinger 1988, Peres and Vooren 1991, Freer 1992), although Ripley (1946) noted 150 cm for females and McCord (2005) reports 101 cm for males. <br/> <br/>Reproduction is aplacental viviparity with average litters of 20 to 35 pups, with as few as six and as many as 52 observed with an average of 35 in the Eastern North Pacific (Ripley 1946, Ebert 2003)) produced in spring or early summer after a gestation period of ~12 months; the young vary in length at birth between 26 and 40 cm, depending on the region. The litter size increases in larger females. Males appear to breed every year but individual females have been reported to breed every year in the Mediterranean, every second year in Australia, and every third year in Brazil (Capape and Mellinger 1988, Peres and Vooren 1991, Olsen 1954). These may reflect real differences or may be due to the difficulties of sampling a species, which shows marked temporal and spatial sexual and size segregation, and which makes extensive movements. <br/> <br/>These animals are very long-lived and are estimated to live for up to 60 years, although estimates vary (from around 22 years to around 40 years to up to 60 years) with region and ageing methods used. In Australia, tags have been returned from animals at liberty for more than 40 years. Age at maturity is 8 to 10 for males and 10 to 15 for females (Olsen 1954, Peres and Vooren 1991, Freer 1992, Walker 1999, Ebert 2003). The annual rate of population increase has been estimated by Cortes (2002) at 1.077 ( 95% C.I. 1.037 to 1.128) and the natural mortality by Smith <em>et al</em>. (1998) at 0.113. <br/> <br/>The species feeds mainly on teleost fish, most often on bottom-associated species although pelagic fish are also taken (Walker 1999). Cephalopods, mostly squid and octopus, are also important in their diet. Small juveniles include a high proportion of crustaceans and other prey such as annelids and gastropods in their diet (Olsen 1954, Stevens and West 1997, Walker and Punt 1998). Predators (especially of juveniles) include the great white shark <em>Carcharadon carcharias</em>, sevengill shark <em>Notorynchus cepedianus</em>, and possibly marine mammals (Ripley 1946; Ebert 2001, 2003).","<em>G. galeus</em> has a long history of exploitation in target fisheries in most parts of its range where the species has been in demand for liver-oil, meat and fins. The main threat to the various populations of <em>G. galeus</em> is from targeting widely with gillnets and longlines. Minor threats include fishing with trawls and other methods. There is accidental capture of pups on nursery grounds in gillnets of small mesh-size and recreational fishers operating in inshore shallow-water areas. Habitat degradation in potential nursery areas due to development and siltation may also negatively affect recruitment to populations of this species.  Other threats are habitat degradation by the effects of trawling through disturbance of substrates (Walker 1998) and installation of high voltage direct current sub-sea cables with induced magnetic and electric fields across their migration lanes (Walker 2001). <br/> <br/><strong>Australasia</strong> <br/>In south-eastern Australia, the harvest of <em>G. galeus</em> began in the mid-1920s, but increased markedly during the war years with the market for shark liver oil. Catches levelled off at about 2,000 t live weight during 1949 to 1957 with the decline of the liver market and as the fishery spread from inshore to offshore waters (Olsen 1959). Establishment of the shark meat market and the introduction of gillnets in 1964, production rose rapidly to peak during 1969 at 3,158 t. Following a ban on the sale of large school sharks in 1972 because of high mercury levels, catches declined for about 10 years. With relaxation of the mercury laws catches again increased, reaching 3,060 t during 1986. Since 1986, the total annual catch from the Southern Shark Fishery had declined to 172 t by 2001 (Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2002). The mature biomass has been estimated from age-based model outputs to be below 20% of the level before commercial target fishing began (Punt <em>et al</em>. 2000). <br/> <br/>In New Zealand, <em>G. galeus</em> have been exploited since the mid-1940s. With the demise of the liver oil fishery in the 1950s, a market for the meat developed (some is exported to Australia) and catches peaked at 5,000 t live weight in 1984 (Francis 1998, Paul and Sanders 2001). Catch levels have been ~3,000 t for the past decade, but it is not known if this, or the current commercial TACs (3,107 t), are sustainable, or if they are at levels that will allow the stocks to move towards a size that will support the maximum sustainable yield. <br/> <br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong> <br/>In this region mean annual individual fecundity is only seven pups, age at first breeding is about 13 years in both sexes, and natural mortality rate is low as evidenced from the longevity of 40 years (Peres and Vooren 1991, Ferreira and Vooren 1991). These parameter values characterize the species as susceptible to recuitment overfishing. In Uruguay the species was fished intensively in the 1940s for liver oil. The southwestern Atlantic population of the species has been subject to intensive fishing in its entire area of distribution since about 1985. Statistics of the fishery CPUE in south Brazil and Uruguay are evidence that as a result of intensive fishing from 1985 the abundance of the species had decreased by 85% in 1997, and the fishery in this region continues without restraint (Miranda and Vooren 2003). Since 1995 the species has disappeared in the coastal fishery off Uruguay (A. Domingo unpublished data). The species migrates seasonally between wintering grounds in south Brazil and Uruguay and summer grounds off Argentina where the pupping and nursery areas are situated, where intense and directed fishery of gravid females occurs and where critical habitat is known to have been lost (e.g., BahÃ­a Blanca and El RincÃ³n). Yields in Argentina dropped sharply after intensive fishing and high landings in the years 1988 to 1992 (Chiaramonte 1998). Since then declines have continued. The declared landings for ""sharks+cazÃ³n"" in the SAGyP statistics (the national authority for fisheries in Argentina), and in which <em>G. galeus</em> comprises most of these landings, show overall declines of over 80% between 1992 (4,012 t) and 2004 (757 t), with landings around 1,000t or less since 2000, yet in the mid-1980s the landings were &gt;5,000 t. These declines are attributed to recruitment overfishing and if the fishery continues, the population will very likely be extirpated. Despite this, in the late 1990s new access to the fishery was granted to a large number of artisanal fishermen (at present around 700 are registered in Buenos Aires province), and no management is in place. <br/> <br/><strong>South Africa</strong> <br/>In South Africa <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> is targeted (mainly when catches from other non-elasmobranch fisheries are low) in longline and handline fisheries and taken incidentally in artisanal and recreational fisheries. In 2003, 23 permits were issued to shark fishermen, however no seasonal/temporal restrictions have been placed on the fishery nor on number or size of <em>G. galeus</em> landed. Kroese and Sauer (1998) determined that the landed catch of soupfin shark between 1992 and 1994 reached a peak of 48 t (1994, dressed carcass weight) and a minimum of 5.2 t in 1993. Anecdotal evidence suggests that CPUE of soupfin sharks has declined in the last 15 years (G. Kingma, soupfin shark longline fishermen, Hout Bay, Western Province, pers. comm. February, 2003) and data from the South African Shark Management Plan (MCM 2002) indicates that the annual commercial linefish catch of soupfin shark has significantly declined, from a peak of 249 t in 1992 to 71 t in 1999. It is unclear whether this is due to a change in target species, change in effort, or change in the population size. According to Freer (1992), 41.6% of total catch by mass in the Gansbaai longline fishery is female, 87.4% of which are immature females. This indicates that a relatively high number of immature females are being extracted from the population, thereby possibly influencing future recruitment (Freer 1992). Similar to other populations of soupfin shark, those in South Africa segregate according to sex and size. This combined with life-history parameters make these sharks vulnerable to over-exploitation. There are indications that the South African population is currently being fully exploited and any increase in fishing pressure may result in a decline of biomass to below 40% of the pre-exploitation condition (McCord 2005). <br/> <br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong> <br/>Tope is of limited commercial importance in commercial fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic where it is typically a bycatch of mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries, especially French vessels fishing in the English Channel, Western Approaches and northern Bay of Biscay. Data is apparently limited, as landings data are often included as ""dogfishes and hounds"". Nevertheless, England and France have species-specific landings data and there are limited data from Denmark and Ireland in recent years (ICES 2004). France appears to target tope, and reported landings of approximately 350 to 500 t/year during the 1990s (landings were higher in 1987 at 600 t, some 6% of the total shark catches, with tope ranking third behind spurdog and lesser spotted dogfish). Tope also feature in catch statistics for Portugal Mainland and in the Azores. In the Azores this species is a bycatch of the demersal longline fishery. Biological data for Northeast Atlantic stocks are limited (SGRST 2002). <br/> <br/>Tope is important in recreational fisheries with some anglers specializing in tope catching. Recently, a newspaper article (Fishing News, June 17th 2005) urged English North Sea fishermen to target tope for meat and for the fin trade out of Lowestoft, East Anglia. This has raised cause for concern, including among the recreational fishers (see www.sharktrust.org for further details). The value of this species for recreational angling on the south coast of England (and presumably elsewhere off the UK) is high. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong> <br/>Although no direct fisheries for <em>G. galeus</em> exist in the Mediterranean, it was traditionally caught as bycatch in gillnets and trammel nets in the Northern Adriatic Sea, also as bycatch of semi-industrial (Adriatic Sea and Sicily) and artisanal fisheries in pelagic and demersal nets, deep longlines, drift lines and troll lines (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 1987). A small directed gillnet fishery targeting <em>Mustelus</em> spp. and <em>Squalus</em> spp. operated off the Balearic Islands in the past which reported catches of <em>G. galeus</em>. In recent times, only bottom trawl and longline fisheries have reported continuous bycatch of <em>G. galeus</em>, and such reports are very rare nowadays. The development of the bottom trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean over the first half of the 20th century in the northern range, and during the latter half in the southern range, is considered as one of the principal factors responsible of the decline of many demersal elasmobranch species. In this sense, both overfishing and habitat degradation must be considered as factors potentially responsible for declines. The analysis of the Medits trawl survey data from 1994-1999 shows a very low frequency of occurrence for <em>G. galeus</em> in the Mediterranean (only five positive hauls or 0.05 %), although it should be noted that trawling is a minor threat to this species and numbers in trawl surveys would not be expected to be high. Its overall biomass was estimated to be 0.2 kg/kmÂ² for the Mediterranean. The standing stock biomass was estimated at 126 t (0.23%) (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Off Italy, Relini <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported the capture of <em>G. galeus</em> in only one of the 11 zones studied as part of the Italian national project (9,281 hauls in total, around the Italian coast, from 1985-1998), although data on biomass for this species were not provided. Tuna trap data from the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea from 1898 to 1992 shows a dramatic decrease in the abundance of <em>G. galeus</em> catches (80 individuals between 1898 and 1905; only eight for the 1906 to 1913 period and 0 from 1914 to 1922) (Vacchi <em>et al</em>. 2002). Thus, these data can perhaps be interpreted as an indication of early depletion of the population at least in shallow waters in this area, which could also have occurred in other Mediterranean areas where similar practices historically operated. Data from the Medits survey for the Adriatic Sea were compared with those from the survey Hvar, carried out in 1948 (Jukic-Peladic 2001). Although no data on individual species captured biomass are reported, <em>G. galeus</em> appeared in the 1948 survey, but not in the Medits survey. Data on elasmobranch landings from the long-line fleet at the Palma de Mallorca (Balearic Islands) central fish auction wharf reported only one specimen in 1996 (B. Reviriego pers.comm.), six in 1999 (G. Morey pers.comm.) and recent regular visits have reported no further specimens. In addition, <em>G. galeus</em> was not specifically reported in the official landing statistics, since it did not appear in the 1999 to 2001 period, thus furthering the difficulties in monitoring of the population. For the Spanish long-line fleet off the Levantine coast, operating mainly in the Alboran Sea and around the Balearic Islands, the observed catch rate (as bycatch) of <em>G. galeus</em> is about five specimens per ship and year (D. MacÃ­as pers.comm.) In Tunisian waters, where there exists a lower fishing pressure than off the northern Mediterranean coasts, the species is considered to be very rare (Bradai 2000). <br/> <br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong> <br/>In the Northeast Pacific the shark fishery off California rapidly expanded during the 1930s due to the demand for liver-oil. Catches increased, peaking at 4,185 t in 1939 with around 75 to 80% of the catch being <em>G. galeus</em> and prices for the liver-oil rose from some US$50/t in 1937 to US$2,000/t in 1941 (Ripley 1946). While the fishery was intensive and expanded rapidly it only lasted eight years, during which CPUE was reported to decline dramatically. Although the fishery collapsed in the 1940s (due primarily to the synthetic production of Vitamin A) it seems unlikely that the stock itself collapsed. Only the large animals were being targeted, with 10-inch mesh size, fishermen were not interested in catching the young animals, which had lower grade Vitamin A in the liver oil. Therefore while it appeared that the adult stock might have collapsed there would have been large stocks of juveniles to allow for a population recovery. Since the 1940s given the low price for soupfin shark and low interest in the meat there has been no economic incentive to target it, and it is now caught at low levels as bycatch with bottom and pelagic gillnets, bottom and pelagic longlines, bottom and pelagic trawls, and with hook-and-line. (Ripley 1946, Ebert 2003, Compagno in prep b). Thus although there has been no stock assessment for over 50 years, the fishing mortality can be expected to be low. Cailliet <em>et al</em>. (1992) reported the fishery over the past several decades had remained fairly steady, even declining due to increasing fishing restrictions.","This species makes extensive migrations, for example, animals tagged in the United Kingdom showing mixing throughout their Northeast Atlantic distribution and being recaptured as far away as to the north of Iceland (2,461 km), the Canary Islands (2,526 km) and the Azores (1,610 km off the coast of Portugal) (Fitzmaurice 1979, Holden and Horrod 1979, Stevens 1990). In Australia, tagging has shown mixing across most of the southern half of the continent (with movements of up to 1,260 km) and a number of animals have moved across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand (Olsen 1984, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>Spatial and temporal variations in size structure and sex ratio are apparent for various populations of <em>G. galeus</em> (see Walker 1999), which have implications for management. The species appears to have fairly discrete pupping and nursery areas, which are often in shallow, protected bays and estuaries (Olsen 1954).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Australasia</strong>
<br/>Inshore waters of Victoria and Tasmania include nursery areas for this species. Olsen (1959,1984) reported a decline in abundance of juveniles in two Tasmanian nursery areas sampled regularly over a five-year period. He attributed this decline to fishing pressure on pregnant females during their pupping migration and to intensified fishing of juveniles in inshore areas such as Port Phillip Bay during the period 1940 to 50. In Port Phillip Bay during 1943 to 1945, 60,000 juveniles averaging 0.9 kg in weight were caught annually. A continuation of this nursery area sampling during the 1990s (Stevens and West 1997) indicated a substantial further reduction in abundance of school shark pups and small juveniles in Tasmanian and Victorian embayments and estuaries. Since the abundance of pups sampled in these areas seems insufficient to account for the current adult stock size it is likely that other pupping areas exist, either outside Victoria and Tasmania, or more likely, close inshore along ocean beach coastlines. In New Zealand inshore embayments such as Kaipara Harbour are nursery areas for this species (Walker 1999).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong>
<br/>The southwest Atlantic population of <em>G. galeus</em> migrates seasonally between wintering grounds off south Brazil and Uruguay, and summer grounds off Argentina where the pupping and nursery areas are situated.
<br/>
<br/>In the wintering area off south Brazil the species occurs from April to November, south of latitude 33Â°S over smooth bottom at depths of 40 to 330 m (Vooren 1997). Only large juveniles (mostly with TL from about 70 cm onwards) and adults of both sexes migrate in winter to south Brazil, where at that time the gravid females concentrate during the final phase of gestation and where the non-gravid adult females copulate in a specific area on the upper continental slope (Peres and Vooren 1991, Ferreira and Vooren 1991). Birth does not occur in south Brazil.
<br/>
<br/>In Argentina the commercial fishery operates inshore at depths of 18 to 57 m, from September to December off Buenos Aires Province, then in January and February in northern Patagonia, then in March-April again off Buenos Aires (Chiaramonte 1998, ElÃ­as <em>et al</em>. 2004). These periods correspond with the months of departure and arrival of the species in south Brazil. It is inferred that the age groups older than about five years of the population as a whole migrate between Argentina and south Brazil, and that the nursery grounds are situated in Argentine waters and in some cases are where critical habitat is known to have been lost (e.g., BahÃ­a Blanca and El RincÃ³n).
<br/>
<br/><strong>South Africa</strong>
<br/>Little is known about the movements of the South African population of <em>G. galeus</em> (Freer 1992). Seasonal differences exist in catch composition, females comprise the majority of the catch (~90%) from December to January and males comprise close to 100% of the catch between April and September (Freer 1992, M. Kroese pers. comm. 2003). Catch records from the RV Sardinops and RV Africana indicate that midsummer (December) catches are dominated by pregnant females (Freer 1992). Individuals have been caught up to depths exceeding 400 m, although they are most frequently caught between 55 to 150 m (McCord 2005). It is thought that female <em>G. galeus</em> give birth in lagoons and estuaries along the west coast of South Africa (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989), and although no nursery areas have been conclusively identified, Freer (1992) suggests shallow embayments such as Struis, St.Helena, Walker and False Bays, and data from the Gansbaai longline fishery with a high proportion of the catch being immature females may also be a nursery area for this species (M. McCord pers. comm).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>
<br/>Little is known regarding critical habitats but nursery areas may occur off Portugal and around the Canary Islands (Munoz-Chapuli 1984), and possibly in the Bristol Channel, UK (see Walker 1999 for further details).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong>
<br/>In the eastern North Pacific, young and immature sharks are caught off Ventura Flats, San Francisco Bay, Monterey and Tomales Bay. Southern California below Point Conception (especially Ventura Flats, east of Santa Barbara) is an important <em>G. galeus</em> nursery ground, with considerable numbers of adult females and newborns being found there in the spring.  They are known to segregate by sex and size. South of Point Conception, adult males tend to be found further offshore in deeper water (>20 m), while females are in usually found in shallower water (<15 m). The proportion of large mature males is highest in northern California, while mature females are most abundant in southern California. North of Point Conception there is a greater proportion of smaller immature females, but in central California the sex ratio is about even (Ripley 1946, Ebert 2001, 2003). They are highly migratory, moving north during the summer and south during the winter or into deeper waters. They are swift moving and can travel up to 34 miles per day and have been reported to travel at a sustained rate of 10 miles per day for up to 100 days. One shark tagged off Ventura in southern California was captured 26 months later off Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Another shark was tagged in San Francisco Bay and recaptured 12 months later in the same location.",Decreasing,"Widespread in temperate waters.
<br/>
<br/>In southern Australia the species occurs from Perth in Western Australia to Morton Bay in Queensland, including Lord Howe Island (uncertain) and Tasmania. It also occurs in the Southwest Atlantic (on the shelf from southern Brazil to Patagonia) and Northeast Atlantic (including the Mediterranean where it is present but uncommon (Whitehead 1984, Notarbartolo e Bianchi 1998), eastern North Pacific (from British Columbia to southern Baja California including the Gulf of California), off Peru and Chile, and in the South Pacific, New Zealand and off South Africa (Compagno in prep b). In the Subequatorial Africa region, it ranges from Namibia to East London on the southeast coast of South Africa (Compagno in prep b). It is absent from the Northwest Atlantic and Northwest Pacific.",,Marine,"Outside Australia and New Zealand there are no, or few, regulations established for populations of <em>G.galeus</em>, see Walker (1999) for a fairly recent review. However, there is increasing international recognition of the threats facing this species. At the CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP) 13 held in 2004, the CITES Animals Committee had a specific recommendation regarding <em>G. galeus</em>. The following text is taken from CoP13 Doc. 35, Annex 2 (<a href=""www.cites.org"">CITES</a>): <em>G. galeus</em> are valued for their meat and fins and are (or have been) important in target and multispecies fisheries in temperate waters world-wide. Most stocks are shared between several range States, and in most regions are seriously depleted. Only a small number of States have achieved successful management of this biologically-vulnerable species. The Animals Committee recommends that range States request FAO's assistance with developing a capacity building workshop for this species in order to train managers from developing States and other States where coastal shark fisheries are not being managed. This would also serve as a case study for the management of other coastal shark fisheries. <br/> <br/>In addition, CITES CoP13, Decision 13.42 directed to Parties states that Parties ""should take note of the species-specific recommendations in document CoP13 Doc. 35 Annex 2 with a view to ensuring that international trade is not detrimental to the status of these species."" This includes <em>G. galeus</em>. <br/> <br/>See Walker (1999) for a fairly recent and thorough review of relevant management measures, some updates are provided below: <br/> <br/><strong>Australasia</strong> <br/>Management measures in the fishery of southern Australia where the stock is most depleted include limited entry for the use of gillnets and longlines (since 1984) and, for all fishing sectors, TAC (since 2000). Input controls include limits on length of net (since 1988), various 4 to 6 week closed seasons to protect pregnant animals of <em>G. galeus</em> during October to December (1953 to 1967 and 1993 to 1994), and a legal minimum mesh-size of six inches for gillnets (since 1975) for most of the fished area. Closed areas to commercial gillnetting in inshore waters of Tasmania have been variously implemented since 1954 to protect newborn, juvenile and pregnant <em>G. galeus</em> on nursery areas. A more extensive closed area was adopted during 1988 when all Victoria proclaimed waters (inside three-mile limit) were closed to the use of shark gillnets and longlines. Legal minimum lengths were phased in by the States and Commonwealth during 1949 and the early 1950s and remain current. During 2002, the TAC for <em>G. galeus</em> was 269 t for the Southern Shark Fishery, 33 t for the South East Trawl Fishery, and 2 t for the Great Australia Bight Trawl Fishery. <br/> <br/>In New Zealand, minimum mesh-sizes of 125 mm and 150 mm apply for <em>G. galeus</em> in northern New Zealand and southern New Zealand, respectively. Numerous general restrictions apply to the use of commercial and recreational gillnets and longlines, including limits on the length of gillnets, number of hooks per longline, number of longlines, soak time, the amount of an estuary or bay that can be blocked by a gillnet, and areas that can be fished. The restrictions vary regionally and are designed to reduce the number of nets lost and the amount of fish wasted to sea lice and decay because of excessively long sets, and to minimise conflict with other users of inshore waters. Also, <em>G. galeus</em> is covered by the mixed species daily bag limits for recreational fishers of 20 and 30 fish for the northern and central regions and southern region of New Zealand, respectively. In October 1986, the commercial TAC was set at 2,590 t, but this had increased to 3,107 t by 1995 to 1996 (as a consequence of quota appeals, not stock assessment) and was current in 2003. The commercial TAC was exceeded by up to 10% in the late 1990s. <br/> <br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong> <br/>In the El Rincon area of Argentina where gravid females occur, a restriction has been established for the fishing fleet during the months in which these sharks approach the shore (A. Massa pers. comm). No other conservation or management measures are in place for this species. A ban on fishing <em>G. galeus</em> is recommended at the regional level involving Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. <br/> <br/><strong>South Africa</strong> <br/>There are no conservation measures in place at present. Proposed policy for 2005 indicates that long-term rights for the elasmobranch fishery will be allocated and multi-species permits will be revoked and replaced with single-species permits. It is envisaged that only six demersal longline permits will be issued to target soupfin sharks. The number of traditional handline vessels permitted to catch traditional linefish (including sharks) will also be restricted in terms of numbers. This will alter the characteristics of the fishery and it is highly recommended that another stock assessment be completed within 3-5 years to evaluate the effect of the aforementioned changes on the population. McCord (2005) made several management recommendations for the period 2005-2010 including restrictive licensing, size restrictions and seasonal/area closures. <br/> <br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong> <br/>There are no conservation measures in place currently other than in California, gillnets are prohibited in State waters, although gear regulations do not apply specifically to <em>G.galeus</em> here or in other areas of its Eastern North Pacific range. The status of the population is unknown, and this species hasn't been intensively studied for over 50 years. The situation needs to be studied in detail in terms of stock assessment and biological parameters (e.g., age and growth has never been studied for the species in this region), and this assessment revisited when more information is available.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although they sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas, they are primarily an alpine and sub-alpine species. Throughout the year, the animals usually stay above the timberline, but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range. Summertime migrations to low-elevation mineral licks often take them several or more kilometers through forested areas. This species is most active during the early morning and late evening, and grazing sometimes continues throughout the night. Their diet includes grasses, herbs, sedges, ferns, moss, lichen, twigs, and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat. Their main predators are cougars, wolves and brown bears. The species lives in groups that can vary from a few to a hundred, and during the winter months, groups generally coalesce to form large herds. The gestation length is approximately 180 days, with a single birth typically, although twins are common in introduced populations. The age of primiparity varies from 2 to 5 years among populations. Male mortality is much higher than female mortality and very few males live longer than 10 years. Very few females survive more than 16 years (Festa-Bianchet and CÃ´tÃ©, 2008).","These animals are largely protected from threats due to the inaccessible nature of their habitat. The species is hunted, but there are regulations in both of its range states that have stabilized past declines. Mountain goats are more sensitive to human disturbance than most other ungulates, and are particularly sensitive to harassment from aircraft. Increasing aircraft use for industrial and recreational purposes on mountain goat habitat is a major concern for their conservation.","The total population in Canada is approximately 58,000 individuals, but could range from 44,000 to 72,000, distributed as follows: Alberta 2,750; British Columbia 39,000-67,000; Northwest Territories 1,000; and Yukon 1,400. Recent total estimates in the United States are 36,000 to 47,000 individuals, with more than 12,000 animals in the contiguous states, and 24,000 to over than 33,000 in Alaska.",Stable,"This species is found in southeast Alaska (USA), south Yukon and southwest Northwest Territories (Canada) to north-central Oregon, central Idaho, and Montana (USA). It has been introduced to Kodiak, Chichagof, and Baranof Islands (Alaska), Olympic Peninsula (Washington), central Montana, Black Hills (South Dakota), and to Colorado, Utah and northeastern Nevada (USA) (Grubb, 2005).<br/><br/>In Canada, mountain goats inhabit all major mountain ranges from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, west to the Coastal Range of British Columbia, and north into the St. Elias, Coast, Cassiar, Logan and Selwyn Ranges of Yukon; and the Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories. In Alaska, the mountain goat is generally continuously distributed along the mountains extending up the west coast to Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. Its also occurs in the southern Wrangell and Talkeetna Mountains and the northern Chugach Mountains. Goat populations have been established through transplants on Baranof and Kodiak Islands. In the contiguous states, it is found in a relatively continuous distribution across several large mountain ranges in Washington, Idaho and Montana. Mountain goats are also discontinuously distributed to the east and south of this area, where many herds have been established by transplanting animals. In Alaska and Washington, separate herds are not always distinguished.","Hunting is well managed in both range states, and this has stabilized past declines.",Terrestrial,"In Canada, mountain goat habitat, along with more than 3,500 goats, are protected in eight National Parks (Banff, Glacier, Jasper, Kootenay, Nahanni, Revelstoke, Waterton and Yoho), Kluane National Park Reserve, and in Kluane Wildlife Sanctuary. Numerous provincial parks and wildlife reserves throughout western and northern Canada provide additional varying levels of protection. Limited hunting by aboriginal people is permitted in some northern national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and licensed hunting is permitted in many provincial parks. Outside protected areas, goats are legally hunted under strict controls issued by provincial or territorial government agencies. Harvests are set annually for each population. In British Columbia for example, harvest rates vary between populations and range from 0.4 to 9% (Hebert and Smith, 1986), with an average of 1,100 to 1,200 goats shot by resident and non-residents each year in the Province. In Yukon, by contrast, harvests are much lower, varying between three and 15 animals per year, with the aboriginal harvest estimated to be zero. Transplants have been used to re-introduce mountain goats into many areas of its former range. Habitat management continues to play a key role in its conservation, and developments are subject to environmental screening processes on public land. Conservation measures proposed for Canada: 1) Determine the speciesâ requirements for mature forests on steep slopes in coastal mountain ranges that are used as winter habitat in British Columbia (Hebert and Turnbull, 1977; Fox <em>et al</em>., 1989). Several coastal populations will be affected by current and future timber harvest operations. Ideally, much or most of this habitat should be preserved. 2) Obtain more accurate population inventories in all regions of Canada to allow more detailed management plans to be developed.<br/><br/>In the United States, primary conservation measures have included habitat protection, introductions and re-introductions, and harvest regulation. Eight state wildlife management departments have transplanted mountain goats from native ranges in Canada and the United States. Six of these states did not have indigenous populations. Many transplanted populations were established with only 10 to 15 founder animals. Goats are harvested in nine states under conservative regulations of the wildlife departments which monitor populations. The mountain goat occurs in nine federal protected areas: Alaska: Glacier Bay, Kenai Fjords, and Wrangell - St. Elias National Parks; and Kenai National Wildlife Refuge; Montana: Bison Range National Wildlife Refuge; Glacier National Park; South Dakota: Mount Rushmore National Monument; Washington: North Cascades, and Mount Rainier National Parks. However, most herds are in national forests including many wilderness areas).

In the eastern tropical Pacific, they prefer equatorial and subtropical waters with a shallow thermocline, relatively large seasonal changes in surface temperature, and seasonal upwelling (Reilly 1990; Fiedler and Reilly 1994). <br/><br/>Mediterranean common dolphins frequent coastal and upper slope waters (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003). In the Black Sea, common dolphins are distributed mainly offshore and visit shallow coastal waters following seasonal aggregations and regular mass migrations of small pelagic fishes such as anchovy and sprat (Birkun 2006). Black Sea common dolphins avoid waters with low salinity, and this may explain why they do not occur in the Sea of Azov and in the Kerch Strait. <br/><br/>Associations with other marine mammal species are common. Schools in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are sometimes associated with yellowfin tuna, and have thus been involved in tuna purse-seine fishing operations (Gerrodette 2002). Mixed-species groups of common, striped and Rissoâs dolphins (<em>Grampus griseus</em>) have been observed frequently in the pelagic waters of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece (Frantzis and Herzing 2002). The prey of common dolphins consists largely of small schooling fishes and squids (Perrin 2002).","The common dolphin is one of the most prominent by-catches of pelagic purse-seine, driftnet and trawl fisheries. In the ETP, common dolphins are sometimes found in association with yellowfin tuna, <em>Thunnus albacares</em>, and annual incidental mortality in the tuna purse-seine fishery of this species has been as high as 24,307 (in 1986) (IATTC, 2006). Since the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) imposed per-vessel stock limits on the international fleet, the mortality declined to 325 in 2005 (IATTC 2006). Takes have been recorded in other purse-seine fisheries in the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Africa (Simmons 1968). Short-beaked common dolphins are the most commonly killed cetacean in the U.S. drift gillnet fishery for sharks and swordfish, with about 2,100 estimated killed between 1990 and 2002 (Julian and Beeson 1998; Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005); measures have been in place to reduce cetacean takes since 1996, and bycatch levels are not a population level concern (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Incidental capture of common dolphins in European Atlantic fisheries has been well studied in recent years, and as a result of recent EU legislation, on-board observer programs are being carried out in most of the fisheries considered to have a potentially significant bycatch of common dolphins. Northridge (2006) showed that bycatches of common dolphins in European pelagic trawl fisheries probably total around 800 animals per year in UK and French pelagic trawl fisheries for sea bass. Annual catch rates in the UK sector of this fishery have been falling in recent years and the annual average total mortality recently (2000-2006) has been 170 animals in this sector. Other bycatches in the same area are known to occur in gill nets, tangle nets and possibly other fisheries (ICES 2005; Northridge 2006). <br/><br/>In the western North Atlantic, 105 common dolphins are taken on average each year by sink gill nets and bottom trawls (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2006). By-catches have also been reported from other areas (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2000; Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>The main factors thought to have contributed, singly or in synergy, to the decline of Mediterranean short-beaked common dolphins include: 1) incidental mortality in fishing gear, especially driftnets, 2) reduced availability of prey caused by overfishing and habitat degradation, 3) contamination by xenobiotic chemicals resulting in immunosuppression and reproductive impairment, and 4) environmental changes such as increased water temperatures affecting ecosystem dynamics (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006). A recent survey focusing on the Moroccan driftnet fishing fleet estimated that about 12,000-15,000 dolphins are killed annually around the Strait of Gibraltar (Tudela <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>At least 840,000 dolphins were taken from the Black Sea from 1946 until a ban of small cetacean hunting was declared in Turkey in 1983. The take was certainly much greater because that value did not incorporate catch statistics from Romania (whole period), Turkey (before 1976 and after 1981) and Bulgaria (before 1958) (Birkun 2006). <br/><br/>Reduced prey availability is considered to be a major threat to Black Sea common dolphins (Bushuyev 2000). Of two mass mortality events that killed an unknown but certainly large number of common dolphins in 1990 and 1994 (Krivokhizhin and Birkun 1999), the latter was recognised as the result of a morbillivirus epizootic. However, both die-offs coincided with a drastic (8 to 12 fold) decline in the abundance of the two main common dolphin prey species, anchovy and sprat. Such a reduction was caused by a combination of overfishing, eutrophication and the explosive increase of the introduced ctenophore <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>. Correlation between large die-offs of Black Sea common dolphins and prey scarcity suggests that reduced prey availability increases susceptibility to viral infection (Birkun 2006). Prey depletion caused by overfishing was considered as a main cause for the decline of common dolphins in the eastern Ionian Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2006).","This is a very abundant species, with many available estimates for the various areas where it occurs. In the Pacific, 2,963,000 (CV=24%) was estimated for the eastern tropical Pacific (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002), and an average of 352.000 (CV = 18%) was estimated for the US west coast based on surveys between 1991 and 2005 (Barlow and Forney in press). Off California, common dolphins show seasonal and inter-annual changes in abundance due to shifts in distribution (Forney and Barlow 1998).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, abundance in European continental shelf waters was estimated at 63,400 (95%CI=27,000-149,000) in 2005 (SCANS-II project; P. Hammond pers. comm.). Offshore, abundance in a block bounded by 53-57ÂºN and 18-29ÂºW was estimated at 273,000 (95%CI=153,000-435,000) in 1995 (CaÃ±adas <em>et al.</em> in press). West of the Bay of Biscay, 62,000 common dolphins were estimated in the fishing grounds of the albacore tuna driftnet fishery in 1993 (Goujon 1996). In the western North Atlantic, 121,000 (CV=0.23) were estimated to occur (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In the western Mediterranean, abundance has been estimated at 19,400 (95%CI=15,300-22,800) in the northern AlborÃ¡n Sea between 2000 and 2004 (CaÃ±adas 2006). Once one of the most common species in the Mediterranean Sea, the short-beaked common dolphin has experienced a generalized and major decline during the last 30-40 years (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2003). Dramatic negative trends were recorded in portions of the central Mediterranean, particularly in the northern Adriatic Sea and in the eastern Ionian Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004; 2006). Recent genetic studies indicate that population structure within the Mediterranean reflects differences in distribution pattern and habitat use by short-beaked common dolphins in the eastern (where the species is predominantly coastal) and western (where it is predominantly pelagic) portions of the basin (Natoli 2004). Genetic exchange between short-beaked common dolphins from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, to the extent that it occurs, appears to involve predominantly animals from the AlborÃ¡n Sea (Natoli 2004). <br/><br/>The population size in the Black Sea is unknown. Line transect surveys have been conducted recently to estimate common dolphin abundance in a few parts of the range. The survey areas are small relative to the total range of the subspecies. Results suggest that current population size is at least several 10,000s, and possibly 100,000 or more (Birkun 2006). By the mid 1960s, the Black Sea subpopulation collapsed due to long-running overexploitation, and a reduction of 70% was inferred. However, directed takes continued until 1983 when cetacean hunting finally ceased. The population has not recovered (Birkun 2006).",Unknown,"The short-beaked common dolphin is an oceanic species that is widely distributed in tropical to cool temperate waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Perrin 2002), from nearshore waters to thousands of kilometers offshore. They regularly occur in some enclosed seas, such as the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan, and separate subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean and Black seas. Short-beaked common dolphins may occur in parts of the Indian Ocean around southeastern Africa and southern Australia, but previous records of this species in other parts of the Indian Ocean and in waters of Taiwan are now thought to have been of long-beaked common dolphins (<em>D. capensis</em>; Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2002).","This species was previously harvested in the Black Sea, but this fishery was closed in 1983.",Marine,"The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

In the eastern North Pacific, the U.S. drift gillnet fishery has been required to use acoustic warning devices since 1996 to reduce cetacean bycatch; however, some bycatch of <em>Delphinus delphis</em> has continued (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>The current ban on driftnet fishing in the Mediterranean should be implemented and enforced as a matter of priority.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

But, estimating the total number of adult females in a nesting population is complicated by the fact that an individual female typically nests several times within a breeding season, and follows a non-annual breeding schedule, with intervals of two to seven years separating consecutive nesting seasons. Individuals also may be reproductively active for decades (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons et al. 1995, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Long-term monitoring is thus essential to document true population change.&#160;&#160; Few long-term studies of nesting Hawksbills exist, in part because sea turtle research did not become popular until the 1970s, and by then many populations had already been reduced to low levels (Meylan 1999).<br/><br/>Interpretation of long-term data can be complicated.&#160; Because Hawksbills mature slowly, an over-exploited nesting population may already be in decline for decades before the damage manifests itself as a decrease in numbers of nesting turtles on the nesting beach.&#160; Meanwhile, documented increases in numbers of nesting females must be interpreted cautiously, as they do not always reflect an absolute increase in the size of the population. In situations where protection is afforded a breeding population that previously had been subject to intense exploitation, numbers of egg clutches laid are likely to rise precipitously at the newly protected rookery.&#160; This is because, with protection, individual females survive not only to lay their full complement of three to five egg clutches within a single nesting season, but also return to breed in subsequent seasons. <br/>&#160;<br/>Because of the extended and complicated life cycle of the Hawksbill, to quantify only a single stage in the life cycle will not always adequately portray the true status of the entire population.&#160; For example, where over-exploitation of nesting females or eggs has impeded reproduction during long periods of time, estimates of population decline based only on numbers of nests may significantly underestimate the overall population decline at those sites because they will not reflect the absence of juvenile foraging turtles in the wider population (Mortimer 1995).&#160; Although studies on foraging grounds are useful, reliable quantitative data on the size of foraging populations, and especially historical data describing foraging populations, are generally not available.&#160; Interpretation of foraging data is further confounded by the mixing of animals from various nesting populations at the foraging grounds (Broderick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Encalada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996). Similarly, recent increases on some Caribbean nesting beaches demonstrate the difficulty in predicting increasing numbers of sea turtles.&#160; Although reduced effort in the Cuban Hawksbill fishery has spared more than 55,000 large animals on its foraging grounds since the early 1990s (Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), to date regional nesting increases are still relatively small. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Data Sources for Index Sites</span>. To assess long term changes in the nesting populations at each of the 25 Index Sites, we used several types of data sources, often in combination with each other.&#160; For sites for which data on annual numbers of nesting females are not available we used other indices of nesting abundance, including numbers of nests recorded, numbers of nesting females killed, numbers of nesting females recorded per unit of patrol effort, and numbers of egg clutches collected for human consumption or for incubation in hatcheries. At some sites, different measures of Hawksbill abundance were used, including tortoiseshell export statistics, and total numbers of slaughtered animals (including both nesting and foraging turtles). The data were derived from a multitude of sources, including published scientific and historical literature and unpublished reports. We are grateful to the numerous researchers, especially the members of the MTSG Hawksbill Task Force, who generously provided their unpublished data and the benefit of their personal experience to ensure that the most up-to-date information be included in this assessment (see Acknowledgements in the Supplementary Material). As noted in the text and accompanying tables, such information is recorded as in lit. citations. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, for sea turtles and other long-lived species, decades of long-term quantitative data are seldom available. Few Hawksbill nest-monitoring projects were carried out in the 20th century on populations that are now depleted or remnants of their former size (Meylan 1999). Nevertheless, to estimate changes in populations over time, the contributions of historically large, but now depleted, populations needs to be considered.&#160; Where quantitative data are lacking, old naturalistâs records, historic egg collection data, and tortoise shell trade statistics are often the best source of information about populations, and can be used to estimate former abundance and subsequent declines.&#160; Unfortunately, while some excellent information about the enormous trade in tortoiseshell is available, in many areas of the world researchers will never know the full extent of the Hawksbill declines that have taken place before and during the 20th century. For example, Hawksbills were likely found in some numbers along the eastern coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic although now they have become scarce.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Extrapolated Data For Index Sites</span>.&#160; In the present assessment, where quantitative data are available, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, and linear and exponential extrapolation functions (IUCN 2001a). In some subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3-generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, we use the raw data to determine the change in population size. However, when it appeared that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, we used extrapolation techniques to determine the overall change. Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, we used both linear and exponential extrapolations to derive a population estimate. However, when either the linear or exponential function produced an obviously unrealistic number, we included the unrealistic figures in the tables summarizing estimated population change over three generations (and noted them as being unrealistic), but we did not use those unrealistic figures to estimate population changes for the ocean basin under consideration (see IND-Table 3, PAC-Table 3, and ATL-Table 3 in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Backward Extrapolations of Increasing Populations</span>.&#160; Significant increases in nesting populations during the past two decades have been recorded at a number of nesting localities, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean at the following Index Sites:&#160; Antigua (Jumby Bay), Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula), Puerto Rico (Mona Island), and US Virgin Islands (Buck Island Reef National Monument). The observed population increases correlate with implementation of protective measures at these nesting sites in combination with decreased exploitation at neighbouring foraging grounds (especially in Cuba).&#160; However, most of these now-increasing populations were not monitored prior to implementation of protective measures (the presence of researchers on the beach is often a significant element of the actual protection afforded such sites). <br/><br/>Using only the raw data available for these now-increasing sites, it would be impossible to estimate the overall rate of population change during the past three turtle generations, since in most cases data for the protected sites are only available from the mid-1980s onward. There is no reason to doubt that these increasing populations had suffered the same sort of declines as other nesting populations in the region for which earlier data exist. Rather than eliminate these populations from the summary calculations for the ocean basin (and over-estimate the rate of decline), we incorporated these data by extrapolating backwards from 1985, using the average population trajectory calculated for all the other Index Sites in the region for which there are data prior to 1985. The results of these calculations are presented in ATL-Table 6 (in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Qualitative Information</span><br/>Numerical historic rates of change in the sizes of nesting populations at the Index Sites describe only one aspect of the global conservation status of the Hawksbill turtle, and tend to be somewhat biased towards those subpopulations for which long-term quantitative data exist.&#160; A wealth of information also exists about the current status of many of the world's Hawksbill nesting populations, as well as the various modern-day factors, both positive and negative, affecting them.&#160; These include:&#160; a) the residual impacts from long-term tortoiseshell trade;&#160; b) current levels of purposeful slaughter and egg collection;&#160;&#160; c) incidental capture in fishing gear; d) destruction of nesting beaches caused by unregulated coastal development, oil pollution, sea level rise and accompanying erosional processes, and elevated incubation temperatures;&#160; e)&#160; damage to foraging habitat caused by sea water warming, and pollution;&#160; and&#160; f) efforts to raise awareness, and to coordinate and legislate protection.&#160; Such information is critical to a complete understanding of the current status of Hawksbill populations around the world. <br/><br/>For 58 countries around the world we have compiled information on current estimated population sizes and qualitative information about current trends in nesting and foraging populations, and the factors influencing them either positively or negatively (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material)&#160; The inclusion of such relatively qualitative information ensures that even those countries with the fewest resources for monitoring and enforcement can be represented in this assessment; and these areas are often the ones where greatest exploitation and declines have occurred (IUCN 2001b).&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the Assessment Process</span><br/>As with any assessment based on historic data or small data sets, there is uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature of Hawksbill biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, and when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Hawksbill, this can be a particularly acute problem. <br/><br/>Since the last Hawksbill assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999), the IUCN Standarads and Petitions Working Group have developed a system of regression equations to address population changes over time and produce estimates of previous population sizes. With care to filter out overly regressed populations, this system appears to be adequate. Scale of population change needs to be cautiously addressed: on the one hand, declines can go no lower than 100%, but potential population increases are limitless. Small population declines that may be difficult to observe annually can be devastating over several generations.&#160; For example, a hypothetical Hawksbill population numbering 1,000 females declining at a steady rate of 1% annually would have declined by 50% in only 68 years and by 75% in 135 years.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Another issue of concern is the fact that most of the increasing nesting populations in the Caribbean were included as Index Sites in this assessment, while many declining populations were not included due to lack of data. At many sites, the simple process of monitoring a population offers significant protection. Meanwhile, adjacent unprotected and unmonitored nesting sites may be suffering significant decline due to poaching and destruction of nesting habitat that are unrecorded. A case in point is that of Antigua/Barbuda, where the relatively small Jumby Bay nesting population, which has been intensely monitored since 1987, has increased by 79% (+23 turtles) during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the other 35 known Hawksbill nesting beaches of Antigua/ Barbuda neither have been afforded protection, nor has the status of their nesting populations been monitored (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; We are concerned that in the Atlantic Ocean, protected populations are over-represented in our assessment, thus causing the assessment to under-estimate the true rate of regional population decline. <br/><br/>Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean, is one of the few places in the world where records of long-term monitoring of both protected and unprotected beaches are available (see IND-Table 4 in Supplementary Material).&#160; For the inner islands of Seychelles, monitoring was conducted at all 22 islands during both the early 1980s and the early 2000s. Nesting populations at the two islands that had been well-protected since the 1970s increased by 389% during a period of two decades; meanwhile, the nesting populations at 13 islands that had received no protection prior to 1994 declined by 59% during the same period.&#160; When all 22 of the inner islands are considered together, there was an overall decline of 24% in the total nesting population between the early 1980s and the early 2000s.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Hawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roles in the Ecosystem&#160; </span><br/>Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, LeÃ³n and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Threats</span>: <br/><br/>The most important threats to Hawksbill turtles, described here, are dealt with in greater detail in the section entitled Regional Overview (see Supplementary Material).<br/><ul><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tortoiseshell Trade</span>. Recent and historical tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Within the last 100 years, millions of Hawksbills have been killed for the tortoiseshell markets of Europe, the United States and Asia. The global plight of the Hawksbill in the latter half of the 20th Century has been recognized by the inclusion of the species in the most threatened category of IUCNâs Red List since 1968 and the listing of all Hawksbill populations on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, since 1977. Nevertheless, trade continued at exceptionally high levels for years as major trading countries acceded to CITES and Japan, the worldâs largest consumer of bekko (tortoiseshell), continued to import shell under a CITES reservation (exception) until 1993. During the period 1950-1992, Japanâs bekko imports were the equivalent of 1,329,044 large turtles (1,408,787 kg). Conservatively estimating that 30% of the turtles taken for the trade were nesting females, nearly 400,000 adult female Hawksbills were killed for the Japanese market in those years, a time frame that approximates a single Hawksbill generation. Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products continues to be a major problem in many countries and, despite international and domestic prohibitions and the lessening of the volume in the last decade, trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas and southeast Asia (Fleming 2001, ChacÃ³n 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Egg Collection</span>. Intense levels of egg exploitation continue in many parts of the world (see IND-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material), especially southeast Asia, where it approaches 100% in many areas (see PAC-Tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Slaughter for Meat</span>. Adult and juvenile Hawksbills are still killed for meat in many areas (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; In some places the meat is used by fishermen as shark bait (J. Mortimer unpubl. data, C. Lagueux, unpubl. data). Fishermen who target lobster and reef fish will commonly take whatever hawksbills they encounter (Carr and Meylan 1980).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Nesting Habitat</span>. Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed for tourism which often leads to destruction of nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Because Hawksbills prefer to nest under vegetation they are particularly impacted by beach-front development and clearing of dune vegetation. Daytime nesting Hawksbills in the Western Indian Ocean are particular sensitive to disturbance from human activity on the coast and in nearshore waters (Mortimer 2004). In other parts of the world such as the Middle East and Western Australia gas and oil refineries seriously disrupt nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5 and PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Foraging Habitat</span>. Hawksbills are typically associated with coral reefs, which are among the worldâs most endangered marine ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000). Climate change has led to massive coral bleaching events with permanent consequences for local habitats (Sheppard 2006) (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hybridisation of Hawksbills with Other Species</span>. At certain sites where Hawksbill numbers are particularly low, they regularly hybridise with other species of sea turtles (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Entanglement and Ingestion of Marine Debris - including Fishing Gear</span>. Hawkbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gill nets (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material) and capture on fishing hooks (Mortimer 1998). Juvenile Hawksbills comprised 47% of all turtles entangled in derelict fishing nets and other debris in northern Australian waters (Kiessling 2003, White 2004). Ingestion of marine debris by Hawksbills is also significant (White 2004).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Oil Pollution</span>. There is evidence oil pollution has a greater impact on Hawksbills than on other species of turtle (Meylan and Redlow 2006). In some parts of the world (especially the Middle East) oil pollution is a major problem (see IND-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).<br/></li></ul><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;""><br/>Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as âone of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the tradeâ (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).<br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the worldâs tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the worldâs most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the regionâs Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world.&#160; In the early 20th Century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was âan established industry in almost every civilized countryâ (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of âwanton destructionâ in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the worldâs largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.<br/><ul><li>In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).</li><li>Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.</li><li>When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.</li><li>In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.</li><li>A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.</li><li>In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was âunquestionably appropriate and must be maintainedâ (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).</li><li>On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,).&#160; In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.</li><li>Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hhawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japanâs sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the regionâs largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asia (20.8%)</span>: nine countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japanâs stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North America (15.1%)</span>: the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%)</span>: 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Oceania (5.8%)</span>: six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg). Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Europe and West Africa (5.4%)</span>: 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.</li><li>In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).</li><li>Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japanâs trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.</li><li>The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.</li><li>Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21st Century Global Trade</span><br/>Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).<br/><ul><li>Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).</li><li>More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesiaâs remaining stockpiles of bekko.</li><li>Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized âas any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpilesâ (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999.&#160; Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).</li><li>In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).</li><li>On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.<span times="""" new="""" roman=""""></li></ul>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Generation Length</span><br/>Generation length is defined as the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Hawksbills mature very slowly, taking 20 to 40 years, and so are long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). In the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, Hawksbills may mature in 20 or more years (Boulon 1983, 1994; Diez and van Dam 2002; Krueger in litt. 2006). Age to maturity in the Indo-Pacific requires a minimum of 30-35 years (Limpus 1992; Limpus and Miller 2000; Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2003). In northeastern Australia, first breeding is estimated to occur at 31-36 years for females and 38 years for males (Limpus and Miller 2000).<br/><br/>Data on reproductive longevity in Hawksbills are limited, but becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches.&#160; During the last decade, numerous individual Caribbean Hawksbills have been recorded actively nesting over a period of 14-22 years (C.E. Diez in litt. 2006, Z. Hillis-Starr in litt. 2006, Parrish and Goodman 2006). In the Indo-Pacific&#160; Mortimer and Bresson (1999) and Limpus (1992) have reported nesting over 17-20 years, comparable to other Chelonid turtles which range from 20 to 30 years (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).<br/><br/>Given estimated ages to maturity of 25 years in the Caribbean and 35 years in the Indo-Pacific, with half of reproductive longevity estimated at 10 years, a conservative generation length of 35 years (25 + 10 years) is calculated for the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and 45 years (35 + 10 years) in the Indo-Pacific. In analyzing the data, declines over three generations are therefore measured for up to 105 years in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and up to 135 years in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, generation length may well have been longer in the days when population density was higher (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nesting Population Size and Fecundity</span><br/>Sea turtle population trends are best diagnosed using in-water abundance estimates coupled with estimates of demographic parameters such as survival and recruitment possibilities (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001, Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, these data rarely exist for sea turtle populations and so most assessments are based on evaluating nesting trends, which assumes a close correlation between population trends and nesting activity (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/>&#160;<br/>For this assessment the size of a nesting population is defined as the average number of individual females nesting per year. In some cases, population numbers can be determined by saturation tagging of nesting females or by recording the total number of slaughtered nesters. More often, however, population estimates need to be derived from records of the total number of egg clutches laid during a season. Saturation tagging of nesting females indicates that at most sites the average female Hawksbill lays between three and five egg clutches during a single nesting season (Richardson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999), with indications that newly recruited females lay fewer egg clutches (Mortimer and Bresson 1999, Beggs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and possibly fewer clutches in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Pilcher 1999). Following the pattern of earlier status reviews, the present assessment calculates the annual number of nesting females by dividing the total number of egg clutches recorded, by three to five to produce a bracketed population estimate.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population Trends and Conclusions</span><br/>In many parts of the world, Hawksbill populations have continued to decline since the publication of the previous Red List Assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Continuing losses in southeast Asia are of particular concern. Hawksbills face multiple, severe threats. The volume of the tortoiseshell trade has diminished, yet it remains active and substantial, and the Japanese bekko industry remains intact.<br/><br/>In 2001 the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee upheld the Critically Endangered listing of the Hawksbill, based on ongoing and long-term declines in excess of 80% within the time frame of three generations and ongoing exploitation (IUCN 2001b). The Subcommittee review cited âconvincing evidence of reductions in excess of 80% over the last three generations at many, if not most of the important breeding sites throughout the global range of the speciesâ. Not surprisingly, those declines reflect the intensity of the tortoiseshell trade in the 20th Century. Although some relatively large populations still exist, especially in Australia, this is not inconsistent with long-term global or even regional population reduction over three generations (a point noted by the Subcommittee). Unlike previous reviews of the status of the Hawksbill, the present assessment is quantitative and provides a numerical basis for the global listing of the species as Critically Endangered. The 2001 findings of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee are as valid today as they were six years ago.<br/><br/>The current assessment clearly demonstrates the importance of protection in both terrestrial and marine habitats. With protection, some populations have stabilized, and others are now increasing, most notably in the Caribbean. The increases documented in the Caribbean coincide with dramatic reductions in take on the foraging grounds of Cuba which have, in effect, spared tens of thousands of large Hawksbills since the early 1990s. Such increases provide hope for the future, but unfortunately are still the exception rather than the rule. Similar results are needed elsewhere.",Decreasing,"<p>The Hawksbill has a circumglobal distribution throughout tropical and, to a lesser extent, subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. Hawksbills are migratory and individuals undertake complex movements through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes. Hawksbill nesting occurs in at least 70 countries, although much of it now only at low densities. Their movements within the marine environment are less understood, but Hawksbills are believed to inhabit coastal waters in more than 108 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989, Baillie and Groombridge 1996; see Regional Overviews in Supplementary Material).</p>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as âone of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the tradeâ (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the worldâs tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the worldâs most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the regionâs Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world. In the early 20th century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was âan established industry in almost every civilized countryâ (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of âwanton destructionâ in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the worldâs largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.<br/><ul><li>In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).</li><li>Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.</li><li>When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.</li><li>In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.</li><li>A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.</li><li>In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was âunquestionably appropriate and must be maintainedâ (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).</li><li>On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,). In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.</li><li>Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japanâs sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan.

13042842,233,Acipenser medirostris,Near Threatened,,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Acipenser medirostris</em> nearly meets Vulnerable under criterion A2c. Although the estimated population size is above the thresholds for any of the categories for threat, it is not large (34,000â166,000 adults and sub-adults) and the number of mature individuals is unknown.  The estimated number of spawning females for the Klamath River (which supports most of the northern DPS) is only 760â1,500 per year. However, four out of seven (57%) of the known spawning locations have been lost within the last three generations for reasons, not all of which are clearly understood, and may not have ceased or reversible. <br/> <br/>Green Sturgeon are not subjected to overfishing and habitat fragmentation that have affected other sturgeon species. There are active fisheries restrictions in place throughout the speciesâ range in the U.S. and Canada. <br/> <br/>The current adultâsubadult population size is estimated at least in the tens of thousands and there is no evidence of overall population decline, although four of the seven known spawning locations may have been lost. Considerable research is underway or planned to fill in information gaps on stock structure, abundance and migrations.  Although Green Sturgeon currently does not warrant ""threatened"" status under U.S. Endangered Species Act, concerns remain about the limited number of spawning rivers, potential growth of fisheries, and persistent habitat threats from water withdrawals and agricultural pesticides. Given the speciesâ life history characteristics and limited number of spawning sites, it is considered likely that the species would quickly move into a threatened category if current conservation efforts were withdrawn. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","The Green Sturgeon is among the most marine oriented and widespread of the sturgeons. Like most sturgeons, the Green Sturgeon is characterized by large size, longevity, delayed maturation, high fecundity, and far-ranging movements. Green Sturgeon reach sizes up to 2.7 m and have been aged to over 50 years (Nakamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995, Farr <em>et al</em>. 2002). Mortality rates of subadults and adults are low and probably do not exceed 10% per year from natural causes based on age frequency analysis.  Males typically mature at about 15â17 years and 1.5â1.8 m, while females typically mature at 20â25 years and 1.8â2.1 m (Van Eenennaam and Doroshov  2001a). Similarly aged males are generally smaller than females with males from the northern DPS achieving a maximum size of 168 cm, while sexually mature males and females from the southern DPS range in size from 139 to199 cm and 157 to 223 cm, respectively (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Spawning is believed to occur every 3-5 years and the generation time is 27â33 years (Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Green Sturgeon are oviparious broadcast spawners and adult Green Sturgeon typically migrate into freshwater beginning in late February and spawning occurs in April to June in deep, turbulent river mainstems (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Klamath and Rogue River populations appear to spawn within 160 km of the ocean while the Sacramento population may travel over 320 km upriver. Green Sturgeon eggs and larvae are comparatively larger than those of other sturgeon species. For example, Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a egg diameter of 4.34, 3.40 and 2.62 mm for green, white, and Atlantic Sturgeon (<em>A. oxyrinchus</em>) respectfully indicating that Green Sturgeon have eggs which have a volume twice that of white and over four times that of Atlantic Sturgeon. Consequently, Green Sturgeon have a relatively lower fecundity in comparison to other similar sized sturgeon species as reproductive energy is more heavily invested in egg size rather than egg number (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001b, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000). Fecundity varies with age and size, but has been estimated to be in the order of  2,800 eggs per kilogram bodyweight; approximately half that of White Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser transmontanus</em>) at 5,648 eggs per kilogram bodyweight (Moyle 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The eggs do not form a thick jelly coat as do those of other North American sturgeon and exhibit poor adhesion to substrate (Deng 2000, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000), which would indicate sensitivity to turbidity loading  (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1994, Moyle 2002). Furthermore, the larger eggs and higher growth rates of developing Green Sturgeon in comparison to other North American sturgeons suggests that a higher oxygen demand may be required for proper embryonic development; thus Green Sturgeon may require colder, cleaner water for spawning. (USFWS 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Eggs hatch in 7 to 9 days at 15Â°C (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that temperatures above 20Â°C are lethal to embryos and temperatures above 24Â°C significantly reduce five-day larval growth rates. Larvae begin to feed at 10 days post hatch and complete metamorphosis into juveniles at 45 days (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Juvenile Green Sturgeon grow rapidly reaching 60 cm within 2â3 years and they spend 1â4 years in fresh and estuarine waters before dispersal to saltwater (Beamsesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon are commonly observed in bays and estuaries up and down the coast and large concentrations enter the Columbia River estuary, and Washington's Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay during late summer (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Limited tagging studies show that tagged individuals from the Columbia River have been recaptured off the west coast of Vancouver Island (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>During the 1 to 4 years of freshwater residence, juveniles gradually move to deeper and more saline areas as they grow (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). As juveniles grow, they exhibit greater tolerance to salinity and achieve seawater tolerance at seven months or sooner (Allen and Cech 2003). Adults return to freshwater to spawn, and Green Sturgeon have been reported to spawn up to 160 km upstream in the Klamath and Rogue rivers, and over 300 km upstream in the Sacramento River (Beamesderder and Webb 2002). After spawning, they to sea in late autumn to early winter when temperatures drop below 10Â°C and flows increased above 100 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles are opportunistic benthic feeders with a diet consisting of various invertebrates and fish (EPIC 2001, Moyle 2002).  Stomach content analysis indicates that adult Green Sturgeon have a marine diet consisting of various benthic invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms, amphioids, and isopods (EPIC 2001), but have also been observed feeding on sand lances (<em>Ammodytes hexapterus</em>) and other fish.","Sturgeon exhibit a combination of morphology, life history and habitat requirements that make them highly susceptible to negative impacts from human activities (Boreman 1997).  Anthropogenic activities known to impact sturgeon include: exploitation   blockage of available freshwater spawning habitat through diking, damming causing inadequate flow regimes, channelization, elimination of backwater areas, dewatering of streams, destruction of thermal refugia, loss of deep pools, inundation of habitat by reservoirs, and exposure to bioaccumulating industrial and municipal pollution, (Boreman 1997, EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The long life span and late age of maturity makes sturgeon vulnerable to chronic and acute effects of bioaccumulation. White Sturgeon, for example have been found to have the greatest contaminant concentrations compared to salmonids, suckers, Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Pacific Lamprey (<em>Lampetra tridentata</em>), and Eulachon (<em>Thaleichthys pacificus</em>), [USEPA 1999]. Whole body concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (19 Å³g/kg), DDT (787 Å³g/kg), p,pâDDE (620 Å³g/kg), Aroclors (173 Å³g/kg), and dioxins were an order of magnitude higher in concentration than all other species tested.  Although Green Sturgeon are less exposed to anthropogenic contaminants due to their marine migratory phase, there is the potential for exposure when entering freshwater to spawn and during estuarine concentrations. <br/> <br/>Marine and estuarine environments in Canada are of concern as they are heavily impacted by a number of activities including logging, aquaculture, agriculture and urbanization, and can be the eventual sinks to freshwater pollutants. However, a 1994 assessment of the quality of the lower Fraser River ecosystem indicated that no dramatic changes in species assemblages were determined to have occurred since the previous study in 1974 (Healey <em>et al</em>. 1994) despite an increase in usage. Area managed for conservation also increased from 23 to 69% over the same time period with 80% of the increase being accounted for by conservation efforts on the Fraser River estuary (MWLAP 2002). The increase in estuary protection and the results from Healey <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggests that estuarine habitat loss that may effect Green Sturgeon is likely not substantial in Canada. <br/> <br/>In the US, where all known spawning populations occur, Green Sturgeon have lost spawning habitat to poor land use practices and habitat alteration through water management projects (EPIC 2001). This has caused a decline in general water quality in some areas through increased sedimentation as well as the loss of deep pools which Green Sturgeon are known to prefer. Furthermore, damming of river systems can block previously available spawning habitat, affect natural flow regimes, potentially reduce areas of thermal refugia, and change sediment transport characteristics of the river which may cascade and impact sturgeon by modifying ecosystem community structure (EPIC 2001). For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). <br/> <br/>Beamesderfer and Webb (2002 suggest that habitat conditions throughout the Green Sturgeon range have stabilized or are improving, but the results of spawning surveys have yet to substantiate that (NMFS 2002). Most of the northern population segment spawns in the Klamath River. Potential threats to this population include concentration of spawning, harvest (especially in mixed-stock estuarine fisheries), and loss of spawning habitat such as the Columbia River, and the Eel and South Fork, and Trinity Rrivers in California (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The southern population segment (south of the Eel River) is more of a concern because it has fewer spawners (limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin system), which makes it more susceptible to catastrophic events. These fish also face potentially lethal temperature limits, entrainment by water projects, and may be adversely affected by pesticides and other toxic substances and exotic species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is probable that Green Sturgeon spawning habitat has been lost behind dams and water diversions throughout the Central Valley (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District pumping plant). <br/> <br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> <br/>Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in two three fisheries. The smaller bycatch occurs in Klamath River Tribal salmon gill net fisheries while the larger portion is in the White Sturgeon commercial and sport fisheries (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). Total annual harvest of Green Sturgeon declined substantially to 1,192 fish in 1999â2001 from 6,871 fish in 1985â1989. Most of this earlier harvest came from the Columbia River (51%) and Washington coastal fisheries (28%). In recent years, Columbia and Washington coastal harvest was substantially reduced and in 2001 these two bycatch fisheries and that of the Klamath River tribes were about equal in number. Catch reduction in the Columbia River is a result of increasingly restrictive regulations. For the sturgeon sport fishery, slot limits prohibit retention of fish (white or green) less than 107 cm (42 inches) or more than 152 cm (60 inches). Green Sturgeon retained as bycatch in the commercial fishery must be between 122 and 168 cm (48-66 inches). <br/> <br/>Klamath Tribal fisheries (Yurok and Hoopa) accounted for an average 266 adult fish annually from 1986â2001 with no apparent trend. This fishery is monitored but not regulated. California sport catch of Green Sturgeon, primarily in San Pablo Bay, is not monitored, but is thought to be only a few fish each year (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). California slot size limits for both sturgeon species is 117â183 cm (46â72 inches). <br/> <br/>There is also a bycatch in the domestic trawl fishing industry in B.C., which takes about 171 Green Sturgeon annually (Davis 2004). <br/> <br/>There is no information on the extent of illegal exploitation of Green Sturgeon, but poaching activity on White Sturgeon in the lower Fraser River is a concern (Ptolemy and Vennesland 2003).","Preliminary population genetics results suggest that Green Sturgeon from the Klamath and Rogue rivers are similar to each other but distinct from fish from San Pablo Bay. Green Sturgeon commonly occur in the lower Columbia River (OregonâWashington) and genetic samples taken there appear to be a mixture of the other populations (Israel <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2003) has determined that, based on genetic evidence of discreteness, there are two Distinct Population Segments (DPS's) for Green Sturgeon. The northern population ranges from the Eel River, California, to at least the Rogue River, Oregon. The southern population is principally comprised of the Sacramento River spawning stock.
<br/>
<br/>Their wide distribution, large numbers observed seasonally in some areas, and projections based on demographic rates suggest that total Green Sturgeon numbers are at least in the tens of thousands (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). The largest known spawning stock of Green Sturgeon is that of the Klamath River and its tributary, the Trinity River. The Klamath River population is estimated to number up to 66,000 individuals of which 3,000 would be mature adults. Actual spawner numbers in the Klamath were estimated at 760â1,500 females per year based on average harvest and total mortality rates (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Based on a review of recent tagging studies, harvest analyses, and stock assessments from many locations, Beamesderfer and Webb (2002) estimated that the total adult and subadult population size of Green Sturgeon is within the range of 34,000 to 160,000 fish. Of these, greatest abundance was recorded for the Columbia River estuary, and ocean and bay waters of Oregon and Washington.
<br/>
<br/>Attempts to determine trends in sturgeon abundance in the northern DPS have been inconclusive regarding the status of Green Sturgeon, and the status of the northern Green Sturgeon population is unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Similar attempts to determine the status of Green Sturgeon in the southern DPS were also inconclusive, and with the exception of anecdotal evidence of a reduction of Green Sturgeon entrainment at water export facilities indicative of a population decline, the status of the southern DPS is also unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).",Stable,"Green Sturgeon is an anadromous species that spend most of their life in near-shore marine and estuarine waters from Mexico to southeast Alaska (Houston 1988, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Large concentrations of Green Sturgeon are still found in coastal estuaries, but their range in freshwater has been restricted by damming in some rivers. For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). Spawning is presently known to occur in only three rivers in North America, all of which are in the United States: the Rogue River in Oregon (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Rien <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the Klamath and Sacramento river systems in California (EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002, CDFG 2002, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1992,1994).  Spawning populations have been extirpated from the San Joaquin, Eel, South Fork, and Trinity rivers, and possibly the Umpqua River (EPIC 2001, NMFS 2002). Seasonal concentrations occur in several estuaries including the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Eel, Columbia, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor and the Fraser River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Fishery managers in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have recognized the sensitivity of Green Sturgeon to fishing and have actively restricted commercial and sport fisheries everywhere Green Sturgeon occur. None of the reviews examined mentioned any legal, regional, national or international trade in Green Sturgeon products. This species is not considered as good to eat as White Sturgeon and markets for their flesh are limited. <br/> <br/>Due to life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events Green Sturgeon has a designation of ""Special Concern"" in Canada (Houston 1988, Davies 2004), and no harvest is allowed in Canadian waters. <br/> <br/>In response to a petition to list Green Sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a status review for this species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). NMFS determined that the species is comprised of two distinct population segments (DPS) but that neither warrants listing as a threatened or endangered species at this time (NMFS 2003). However, because of remaining uncertainties about their population structure and status, both DPS populations were added to the agency's list of candidate species and will be reevaluated in five years provided sufficient new information becomes available.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
13043189,234,Acipenser transmontanus,Least Concern,,2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"In 1996, the IUCN SSC Sturgeon Specialist Group assessed the white sturgeon as Lower Risk, near threatened (LR/nt). A re-examination of all the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>Some subpopulations of white sturgeon are of conservation concern: <br/> <br/>1. A recent analysis using a population dynamics model for the Nechako River subpopulation has indicated more than 50% probability of extinction in the wild within the next 20â30 years if the current decline rates continue. The subpopulation is Critically Endangered. <br/> <br/>2. The subpopulation from the upper Columbia River is showing major signs of recruitment failure. It is assessed as Critically Endangered. <br/> <br/>3. The Kootenai River subpopulation has been in general decline since the mid-1960's and the remaining wild subpopulation is comprised primarily of adult sturgeon older than 25 years, with very little recruitment observed in the wild since the mid-1970's. It is currently assessed as Endangered. <br/> <br/>4. The Upper Fraser River subpopulation has a restricted range and is estimated to have no more than 250 mature adults remaining. The subpopulation is Endangered. <br/> <br/>5. The Fraser regional subpopulation has declined substantially since the 1980s and is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>However, the majority of the global population occurs along the west coast of the United States, occurring in several river systems and rearing primarily within the Sacramento-San Joaquin and Columbia-Snake River basins. Within this range, white sturgeon subpopulations enjoy relatively large, albeit fluctuating, adult populations and in some areas, substantial and sustainable recreational and commercial fisheries. Although some impounded reaches show relatively low recruitment and productivity (along with limited unidirectional gene flow), in general this regional population of white sturgeon is still widespread and abundant. The species is considered Least Concern (LC) at this time.","Generally anadromous, but some subpopulations are landlocked and spend their entire life cycle in freshwater. <em>Acipenser transmontanus</em> is the largest freshwater fish species in North America. The largest white sturgeon on record weighed approximately 682 kg and was taken from the Snake River, Idaho in 1898. Individuals from landlocked subpopulations tend to be smaller.","<strong>Sacramento-San Joaquin River subpopulations</strong> <br/>In California, white sturgeon reside mainly within the Sacramento River and its combined estuary with the San Joaquin River. Historical spawning habitat has been lost primarily due to dam construction and water diversions. In the Sacramento River, white sturgeon previously spawned upstream of Shasta Dam prior to its construction in the 1940s. It is also believed the San Joaquin River may have supported white sturgeon spawning prior to the development and implementation of large water diversions for agriculture (Moyle 1976). Results from a recent white sturgeon spawning habitat study reveal that most spawning occurs in a 55 river mile reach of the Sacramento River from Knights Landing to upstream of Colusa (Schaffter 1997). <br/> <br/><strong>Columbia and Snake River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Historically, white sturgeon were abundant in the unimpounded Columbia River (Oregon and Washington) and in the late 1800's supported an intense commercial fishery (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1993). Intensive sturgeon fishing began in 1889 and peaked in 1892 with about 2,700,000 kg of sturgeon landed. The stock was depleted by 1899 after a ten year period of excessive harvest (Craig and Hacker 1940).  Season, gear and minimum size restrictions failed to restore the population. Only after maximum size regulations designed to protect sexually mature sturgeon were enacted in 1950 did white sturgeon rebound in the Columbia River. <br/> <br/>Hydroelectric development within the Columbia River basin beginning in 1933 began to isolate white sturgeon above dams. Today there are 17 landlocked subpopulations upstream of Bonneville Dam (the furthest downstream dam in the Columbia River) including the tributary Snake River (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1993). Productivity appears to vary among the landlocked subpopulations as some support high populations and sustainable fisheries (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999b, North <em>et al</em>. 1999) while others sustain no exploitation due to low recruitment and productivity (PSMFC 1992). <br/> <br/><strong>Upper Columbia River subpopulation</strong> <br/>Extensive study has confirmed spawning by upper Columbia white sturgeon at two locations. The vast majority of spawning occurs at the Pend d'Oreille-Columbia confluence (Waneta tailrace) area near the Canada-U.S. border (e.g., RL&amp;L 1995). Spawning at this site has occurred annually since 1993 - the first year spawning studies were initiated. In 1999, a second spawning area was documented in the upper Columbia River just upstream from Arrow Lakes Reservoir (RL&amp;L 2000). Spawning did not occur at this site in 2000. <br/> <br/>Despite the regularity of spawning events, age structure analyses show that recruitment began to decline in 1969, and has failed entirely since 1985 (RL&amp;L 1995). Changes in length-frequency distribution follow a similar pattern, with a dramatic reduction in representation by smaller fish in ongoing sampling programs (RL&amp;L 1996a, BC Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection, data on file). Sampling in Lake Roosevelt in Washington State, although less intensive, shows a similar recruitment failure (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999, Spokane Tribe, data on file). Thus, recruitment of upper Columbia white sturgeon has failed completely, to the point where continued existence of the subpopulation is at risk. <br/> <br/><strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>For more than the last 100 years, human development has modified the natural hydrograph of the Kootenai River through such activities as Libby dam construction and operation, dyke construction and lowered Kootenai Lake levels. These activities have altered white sturgeon spawning, egg incubation, nursery and rearing habitats, and reduced overall biological productivity.  Although these factors may have contributed to a general lack of recruitment of this unique population of white sturgeon during the last century, the operation of Libby Dam in 1974 is considered to be a primary reason for the populationâs continued decline (Apperson and Anders 1991). When Libby Dam began regulating the Kootenai River, average spring peak flows were reduced by more than 50% and winter flows increased by more than 300%. <br/> <br/><strong>Fraser River and Nechako River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Area of occupancy has no doubt been reduced in the lower mainstem due to the alienation of side channels from dyking activity, the infolding of sloughs and wetlands, development and industrial activity. The loss of sloughs, side channels and other low velocity backwater areas has decreased available juvenile rearing habitat. Loss of side channels may reduce spawning habitat availability as well. In the Nechako, flow reduction has reduced depth and the amount of habitat available in side channels and backwaters.","<strong>Sacramento-San Joaquin River subpopulations</strong> <br/>The California Department of Fish and Game periodically monitors the status of white sturgeon in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system to estimate abundance and mortality rates. The most recent survey completed in 1997 estimated nearly 140,000 white sturgeon (&gt; 40 inches) in the Sacramento River (Shaffter and Kohlhorst 1999). The number of adult white sturgeon fluctuates annually and is largely the result highly variable year classes affecting adult recruitment. For example, strong year classes from the early 1980s recruited large numbers of adult white sturgeon to the fishery beginning around 1994; conversely subsequent severe drought conditions across California from 1987 to 1992 are expected to affect the size of the adult white sturgeon population since reproduction was generally poor during those years (Schaffter and Kohlhorst 1999). As recruitment basically ceases and growth and general mortality reduce the number of legal-sized fish, the adult population should decline the next few years. However, the subsequent series of wet years beginning in 1993 should contribute to another cycle of strong recruitment producing fish that will enter the fishery late in the next decade. The California Department of Fish and Game believes the current low exploitation rates, the ability for white sturgeon to successfully reproduce and recover rapidly from reduced adult populations during wet cycles, and fishing size limits that protect the most productive (i.e., fecund) female white sturgeon suggest that current fishing regulations are adequate to conserve white sturgeon in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin. <br/> <br/><strong>Columbia-Snake River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Today, the white sturgeon population residing in the lower, free-flowing reach of the Columbia River is considered the most productive in the speciesâ range (Devore <em>et al</em>. 1999a). The recreational and commercial harvest in the lower Columbia river has recently averaged over 42,000 annually through 1997. Estimated abundance for legal-sized (42-60 inches) white sturgeon in the lower Columbia River in 1997 was nearly 157,000 fish, a decline from the estimated 227,700 fish in 1995. It appears that the decline was primarily a result of a decrease in the recruitment to the legal-sized population and emigration from the Columbia River system, and not over-harvest. <br/> <br/>Upstream in the first three impounded reaches of the Columbia River the estimated abundance of white sturgeon in 1997 increased from a general population crash in the mid 1980's (North <em>et al</em>. 1999). Generally, white sturgeon increased in all size classes sampled. Researchers suspect that more restrictive harvest guidelines along with some relatively strong year classes in recent years are contributing to increasing populations in recent years. These landlocked populations continue to sustain limited harvest and consumption fisheries. <br/> <br/>Historically within the Snake River, white sturgeon could range from its confluence with the Columbia River upstream nearly 615 river miles to Shoshone Falls, a natural barrier for sturgeon. Twelve dams were constructed along the Snake River between 1901 and 1975 that fragmented white sturgeon populations from the confluence to Shoshone Falls. The abundance of land-locked white sturgeon in the Snake River varies considerably from river reaches with reproducing populations to other reaches containing few individuals and no detectable recruitment. Reaches with reproducing populations currently provide catch and release sport fisheries only. <br/> <br/><strong>Upper Columbia River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The abundance of white sturgeon from the Columbia River mainstem between Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border was most recently assessed in 1995, when a population of 1,120 individuals (95% CI = 980 to 1,300) was estimated (RL&L 1996a). This figure does not include sampling in Lake Roosevelt in Washington State, and thus represents a minimum estimate of the total subpopulation. A smaller group of white sturgeon, considered part of the same subpopulation, has been identified at the upper end of Arrow Lakes Reservoir, located upstream from Keenleyside Dam. Estimates place the size of this group at 38 individuals (95% CI = 23 to 78) based on the results of 2000 studies (RL&L 2001). <br/> <br/><strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The Kootenai River subpopulation has been in general decline since the mid-1960's (Apperson and Anders 1991, Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999). The remaining wild population is comprised primarily of adult sturgeon older than 25 years, with very little recruitment observed in the wild population since the mid-1970's (Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999, Ireland <em>et al</em>. 2000). In 1997, there were an estimated 1,468 adults (95% CI: 740 to 2,197) and 17 juvenile white sturgeon (Paragamian <em>et al</em>. 1997). <br/> <br/><strong>Fraser River and Nechako River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Mark recapture estimates for subpopulations in the Nechako and lower Fraser Rivers (R.L. & L Environmental Services Ltd. 2000), plus the preliminary estimate from work being done by the Lheidli Tâenneh First Nation (Yarmish and Toth 2001) for subpopulation in the Upper Fraser River show the following population sizes: <br/> <br/>Fraser Regional subpopulation:  22,000 (95% CI = 9,800â70,700) <br/>Upper Fraser subpopulation: 255 (95% CI = 158â352)  <br/>Nechako River subpopulation: 571 (95% CI = 421â890) <br/> <br/>The preliminary population estimate for the Upper Fraser River may be skewed by the high recapture rate of individuals found in known areas of congregation. The fish tend to congregate in areas of preferred habitat but can also be found at very low densities in other areas of the mainstem. However, after extensive sampling, investigators do not believe the population can be larger than a few hundred individuals &gt;50 cm in length (Yarmish, pers. comm).",Stable,"The largest component of the white sturgeon population occurs along the west coast of the United States and comprises subpopulations occurring in several river systems and rearing primarily within the Sacramento-San Joaquin and Columbia-Snake River basins. The species is also found in the Kootenai River (United States and Canada), the Fraser River drainage (Canada), and the Columbia River between Hugh Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border. <br/> <br/>There is evidence of emigration from the Sacramento and Columbia river systems based on out-of-system tag studies (PSMFC 1992). These included Chadwick (1959) who cited the recovery of a fish tagged in San Pablo Bay in 1954 and recovered in the Columbia River, and Kohlhorst <em>et al</em>. (1991) who noted that 11 white sturgeon tagged in San Pablo Bay (Sacramento River system) were caught in six river systems north of California, primarily the Umpqua River, Oregon (five tags recovered) and the Chehalis River, Washington (three tags). Also in this study, one tag return each was received from the Columbia River, Yaquina River and Tillamook Bay, Oregon and the Willapa River, Washington. More recently a fish originally tagged in the lower Columbia River was re-captured in the Sacramento River in 1997 (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999a). Population estimates of legal-sized and adult white sturgeon can vary dramatically (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Schaffter and Kohlhorst 1999) but for the most part, this stock is generally believed to be healthy and stable. <br/> <br/>The upper Columbia River white sturgeon subpopulation inhabits the Columbia River mainstem upstream from Grand Coulee Dam. In this area, the largest documented group of the species resides in the area between Hugh Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border. Other remnant subpopulations occur, or are suspected, throughout the remainder of the drainage. <br/> <br/>White sturgeon are found in the Fraser River mainstem from the estuary upstream at least as far as the Torpy River, a distance of over 1,000 km (R.L.&amp;L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). They are also found in a major tributary of the Fraser, the Nechako River and itâs tributary the Stuart River (these two have a combined stream length of about 400 km). However, sturgeon are not evenly dispersed throughout this length of river, but are clustered in suitable habitat.The Kootenai River subpopulation inhabits and migrates freely in the Kootenai River from Kootenai Falls in Montana (United States) downstream into Kootenay Lake, British Columbia (Canada). It is restricted to approximately 270 km of the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The Kootenai River population of white sturgeon was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act on September 6, 1994 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The team completed a final recovery plan for the Kootenai River white sturgeon in 1998 which was subsequently approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in late 1999 (Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999). The recovery plan describes a series of 46 specific conservation measures in the United States and Canada that are believed necessary to recover the endangered white sturgeon.

This species has been taken at depths up to at least 150 meters in the sea. Unverified records indicate presence up to several miles offshore in California and Alaska (USFWS 1994). In estuaries this fish usually is found in the middle or bottom of the water column (Moyle 2002). Adults in lakes occupy deep water by day, move upward in water at night (Wydoski and Whitney 2003). Spawning occurs in fresh water, over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, and aquatic plants (Moyle 2002). Anadromous populations spawn in fresh water close to the ocean. After hatching, larvae move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas. Lake populations spawn in tributaries (Wydoski and Whitney 2003).","<p>Localized threats exist, but on a range-wide scale no major threats are known.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>  Threats have been defined only in areas of known declines in the California portion of the range. Declines in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary in California are due mainly to the effects of water diversions from the Delta (Moyle 2002). Low flows result in upstream movement of the productive freshwater-saltwater mixing zone, constricting the size of favorable habitat and making the fishes vulnerable to diversion into water project pumps and structures (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). It is unlikely that many individuals survive entrainment, but the degree of effect on larvae is not well known (Moyle et al. 1995). Low flows also fail to disperse larvae downstream into productive nursery areas in Suisun Bay (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994, Moyle et al. 1995). The causes for decline in the northern California estuaries are unknown but probably similar to the causes for declines in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002). <br/><br/>Other potential threats include pesticide runoff from agricultural areas and invasions by exotic species such as clams and copepods (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002). Sedimentation due to human activities may also have an effect on northern California estuaries. The loss of tidal marsh habitat and resulting reduced productivity, together with reduced flows in the Mad River due to water diversions and land reclamation, may have caused disappearance from Humboldt Bay, California. Due to a two-year life cycle, relatively brief periods of reproductive failure could lead to extirpations (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994).","This species is represented by at least a couple dozen subpopulations (counting each estuary as a single occurrence or subpopulation).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably exceeds 100,000. This species may be common in Willapa Bay, Skagit Bay, and Puget Sound in Washington and in Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon; it is evidently common to highly abundant in the Columbia River and Grays Harbor, Washington. In Alaska, large numbers are found in the Gulf of Alaska (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994).<br/><br/>Declines are well documented in California, but there is a lack of trend information for most of the remainder of the range, where populations are generally considered common or abundant (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). In the San Francisco Estuary this species historically exhibited wide fluctuations in abundance that paralleled variations in rainfall (lowest abundance during drought years) (Moyle 2002). In California, the species has declined dramatically since the early 1980s in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (Moyle 2002) and has apparently disappeared from Humboldt Bay. In the 1970s this fish was considered abundant in Humboldt Bay, California, but since 1983 numbers have plummeted. Despite extensive sampling it has not been collected from Humboldt Bay since 1994. The remaining California populations are small and of uncertain status (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>Current trends are not well documented in most of the range, but extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, and number of subpopulations probably are relatively stable or declining at a rate of less than 10 percent over 10 years.",Unknown,"Range extends along the Pacific coast of North America from the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary and Monterey Bay (single record), California, north to the southwestern Gulf of Alaska (westward beyond Prince William Sound to the base of the Alaska Peninsula), Alaska; landlocked populations occurs in Harrison Lake, British Columbia, and lakes Washington and Union, Washington (Page and Burr 1991, Moyle 2002, Wydoski and Whitney 2003).

Presence of spring freshets is a factor common to nearly all spawning streams or rivers; typically characteristic of rivers that drain large snowpacks or glaciers (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003).","Threatened by overfishing in subsistence and commercial fisheries, continued/increased bycatch in commercial groundfish and shrimp fisheries, industry pollution of freshwater and marine habitats, human impact on spawning habitat (logging, dredging, diversions, etc.) and climate change (Hay and McCarter 2000). <br/><br/>Subsistence harvest is widespread throughout this species' range, is mostly unregulated, and could potentially slow recovery of declining populations. Bycatch of eulachon in commercial offshore groundfish and shrimp trawl fisheries may be substantial; shrimp trawling, especially, has increased in the last decade (Hay and McCarter 2000). <br/><br/>Threats to eulachon habitat include diversions/dams, logging, dredging and industrial pollution of streams and rivers, all of which may affect water volume, temperature and sediment levels in spawning habitat. Native communities in Southeast Alaska have noted declining eulachon harvests and expressed concern about the effects of log rafting and pollution on fish habitat (Drake and Wilson 1991). <br/><br/>Recent changes in ocean climate, including increased surface water temperatures, have been recognized in the Gulf of Alaska and elsewhere in the species range, and have resulted in a general reorganization of fish communities in some areas (Anderson and Piatt 1999, Hay and McCarter 2000). High water temperatures can be lethal to cold-water acclimated fish.  A study of 5Â°C-acclimated eulachon immersed in 11Â°C water for several days resulted in 50% mortality and spawning failure (Blahm and McConnell 1971 in Willson et al. 2003).","This species is represented by a large number of subpopulations and locations.<br/><br/>In Alaska, this species is seasonally abundant from Southeast to Cook Inlet (Hay et al. 1997); abundance decreases from east to west toward the Aleutian Islands (Bartlett 1994). Relative abundance in the Bering Sea is highest between Unimak Island/end of the Alaska Peninsula and the Pribilof Islands (Anderson, in Willson et al. 2003). Eulachon is reported as widespread in trawl samples in the coastal fjords of northern southeast Alaska (Willson et al. 2003). Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Gulf of Alaska varied almost cyclically between 1972 and 1997 from ~0.3 kg/km to ~1.9 kg/km (Anderson and Piatt 1999). However, catch data are not necessarily considered a reliable measure of population abundance or even presence/absence (NMFS 1999), nor are they available for species' entire range in the state.<br/><br/>Highly variable or possibly cyclical run size makes trends in abundance hard to interpret (NMFS 1999). Nearly all runs in the southern part of their range (California to BC) have declined during the last 20 years (Hay and McCarter 2000). Commercial catches on the Fraser River have declined since the 1940s and 1950s (Hay et al. 1997). In 1994, sudden drastic declines were recorded in three large southern rivers, the Fraser, Columbia, and Klinaklini, resulting in the closure of major commercial fisheries on the Fraser and Columbia Rivers in the late 1990s (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003). Due to continued low abundance, NMFS was petitioned to list the Columbia River populations as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1999. Eulachon runs diminished over the last two decades in the Kitimat River, BC, and became chemically tainted as a result of industry and urbanization (Hay et al. 1997, Hay and McCarter 2000).<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain but likely relatively stable or slowly declining.",Unknown,"Found only in the eastern Pacific, from Monterey Bay, California, to Nushagak River and Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 1991).

21936349,12302,Lontra canadensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The North American River Otter is considered to be Least Concern as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otters had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have enabled river otters to reclaim portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring otter populations in many areas of the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States and water quality and development limit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives (Polechla 1990). There is an ongoing discussion about the problem of reintroduction of river otters. In recent years it is feared that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.","Historical records indicate that river otters were well established throughout most major drainages in the continental United States and Canada prior to European settlement (Hall 1981). The continentâs largest otter populations occurred in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but viable, otter populations (Nilsson 1980). <br/><br/>North American River Otters prefer bog lakes with banked shores containing semi-aquatic mammal burrows and lakes with Beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) lodges, and they avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994b). In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways and positively associated with the number of Beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity (Dubuc <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Idaho, river otters prefer valley over mountain habitats, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Logjams are used intensively where present (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). In Florida, abundance of North American Otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forest. During the dry season, <em>L. canadensis</em> will retreat from marshland and move to permanent ponds where water is available and food is more concentrated (Humphrey and Zinn 1982). In Idaho and Massachusetts, habitat features preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, Beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Newman and Griffin 1994).<br/><br/>The diet of the North American River Otter is comprised mostly of fish that are abundant, mid-sized, and close to shore (Larsen 1984, Stenson <em>et al</em>. 1984), as well as amphibians (mostly frogs) and crustaceans (mainly crayfish) (Knudsen and Hale 1968, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1994a, Sheldon and Toll 1964). Small mammals, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and fruits are consumed opportunistically (Gilbert and Nancekivell 1982, Greer 1955, Hamilton 1961, Morejohn 1969, Verbeek and Morgan 1978, Wilson 1954). North American River Otters have few natural predators in the water: Alligators (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>), American Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>), and Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>). They are considerably more vulnerable on land or ice where Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), Cougars (<em>Felis concolor</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), Domestic Dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) and Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) can kill adults (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Route and Peterson 1991, Toweill and Tabor 1982). Most mortality, however, is human-related and includes trapping, illegal shooting, road kills, and accidental captures in fish nets or set lines (Jackson 1961, Melquist and Hornocker 1983).<br/><br/>North American River Otters can reach 13 years of age in the wild and up to 25 years of age in captivity (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Stephenson 1977). Females usually do not reproduce until two years of age, although yearlings occasionally produce young (Docktor <em>et al</em>. 1987, Hamilton and Eadie 1964). Males are sexually mature at 2 years of age (Hamilton and Eadie 1964). North American river otters usually breed from December to April (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Liers 1951), gestation lasts 61-63 days, and young are born between February and April (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Litter size may reach five (Park 1971) but usually ranges from one to three (Docktor <em>et al</em>. 1987, Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Tabor and Wight 1977).","Threats to otter populations in North America vary among regions and are influenced by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Prior to settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were widespread among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent (Hall 1981). Unregulated trapping and loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries resulted in extirpations or declines in otter populations in many areas (Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Nilsson (1980) reviewed the status of otters in the United States and determined that populations were extirpated in 11 states and had experienced severe declines in nine other states. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported smaller fewer otter populations. Although the distribution of otters became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island (Polechla 1990). <br/><br/>During the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques coincided with increased concern about otter declines in North America (Endangered Species Scientific Authority 1978). Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects (Ralls 1990, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1993). Since 1976 over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced among 21 states. Also, 29 states and all Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of North American Otters are similar for Canada and the United States (Obbard 1987), with most pelts being used in the garment industry (Toweill and Tabor 1982). In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached <em>ca</em> 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million (Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Otters are incidentally harvested by traps set for Beavers (Toweill and Tabor 1982), and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously (Polechla 1990). While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas (LariviÃ©re and Walton 1998). <br/><br/>Oil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other degradation of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution of otters and pose long-term threats if enforcement of water quality standards are not maintained and enforced. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality problem in some areas that eliminates otter prey prevents thereby inhibits recolonization or expansion of otter populations. Recently, there has been discussion of the long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1998). Similarly, many perceived threats to otters such as pollution and habitat alterations have not been rigorously evaluated.<br/><br/>The threat of disease to wild otter populations is poorly understood and has received little study (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1995). <em>Lontra canadensis</em> may be victim of canine distemper (Harris 1968, Park 1971), rabies (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1995), respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984, Route and Peterson 1991). In addition, North American Otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia (Harris 1968). North American Otters host numerous endoparasites such as nematodes (Hoberg <em>et al</em>. 1997), cestodes (Greer 1955), trematodes (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984), the sporozoan <em>Isopora</em> (Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984), and acanthocephalans (Hoberg <em>et al</em>. 1997, Hoover <em>et al</em>. 1984). Ectoparasites include ticks (Eley 1977, Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1992), sucking lice <em>Latagophthirus rauschi</em> (Kim and Emerson 1974), and the flea <em>Oropsylla arctomys</em> (Serfass <em>et al</em>. 1992).","By the early 1900s, unregulated trapping, water pollution, and other degradations of aquatic and riparian habitats had caused otter populations to decline throughout most of their historic range (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Improvements in water quality and furbearer management strategies, including implementation of reintroduction projects, have enabled the re-establishment of otter populations to various aquatic habitats in portions of their former range. Reintroduction projects have been especially useful in restoring otter populations to riverine habitats in interior regions. <br/><br/>Methods for determining relative abundance of North American River Otters include track counts in the snow (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1987, St-Georges <em>et al.</em> 1995), radioactive isotopes (Knaus <em>et al</em>. 1983, Testa <em>et al</em>. 1994), catch/unit effort (Chilelli <em>et al</em>. 1996), and scent-station surveys (Humphrey and Zinn 1982). Density estimates of river otters range from one otter/1.25-3.60 km of coastline in Alaska (Testa <em>et al</em>. 1994) to one otter/3.9 km of waterway in Idaho (Melquist and Hornocker 1983).",Stable,"<em>Lontra canadensis</em> currently occurs throughout the United States of America and Canada. Originally this species is thought to have ranged from 250-700Â°N latitude and from 530 to 1660Â°W longitude. In the USA, this species is present in states bordering the Great Lakes, Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, and in the forested regions of the Pacific coast in North America (LariviÃ¨re and Walton 1998). It is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands and the north slope of the Brooks Range (Magoun and Valkenburg 1977). Urbanization and pollution caused reductions in range area and the species is now absent or rare in Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia (Melquist and Dronkert 1987, Park 1971, Polechla 1990). Reintroductions have expanded the distribution of this species in recent years, especially in the Midwestern United States (Melquist and Dronkert 1987).

They are most common in evergreen forests in the warmer months (Kunz and Martin 1982). Female bats usually only have one young a year (Tuttle 1988). The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 g. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months (Barbourand Davis 1969).<br/>These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight (Barbour and Davis 1969). Mating usually occurs in two phases. In the summer phase, both partners are alert and active, in a time known as the active phase. During the winter, or the passive phase, the females are torpid and the males seek out and find these females and mate with them. The females remain inattentive throughout the entire encounter (Fenton 1985). These bats are insectivorous. They to emerge late in the day to feed (Barbour and Davis 1969). Townsend's Big-eared Bats feed on small moths and either capture these moths from leaves or catch them directly in the air along forested edges (Kunz and Martin 1982).-","This species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of abandonment of roosts caused by disturbance due to explorers and vandals. Minimization of human disturbance is essential for <em>Corynorhinus townsendii</em> to remain in existence (Nowak 1999). Human intervention may have helped conserved the population on the west coast of North America, because man-made structures provide a shelter for Big-eared Bats.","During the winter months, they hibernate either individually or in groups composed of several hundred bats, and they hibernate in mines or caves. In the summer, these bats roost in a wide variety of locations, including limestone caves, lava tubes, and human-made structures. In the summer, the females form nesting roost. Males are solitary during the maternity periods. The maternity colonies consist of one or more small clusters, which rarely exceed 100 bats.

The species is known from just a few locations in southeast Alaska.<br/><br/>The distributional range suggests an association with coastal forest habitat (van Zyll de Jong 1985, Nagorsen and Brigham, unpubl. manuscript). Apparently this bat is associated with mature forests, but it is not restricted to old growth (COSEWIC 2003). Across the range it has been found roosting in southwest-facing rock crevices, among geothermally heated rocks, in tree cavities, in bark crevices, and in buildings (D. Burles pers. comm., Nagorsen and Brigham 1993, Parker and Cook 1996). Tree cavities and loose bark are important natural roost sites and may be limiting in some parts of the range (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004). In British Columbia, one maternity colony (on Hot Springs Island in the Queen Charlotte Islands) is situated within geothermally heated rocks associated with hot spring activity (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004). The only other known maternity colony in British Columbia was suspected to be in a tree located in a low elevation, southwest-facing cliff at Knoll Hill near Tahsis, Vancouver Island (COSEWIC 2003). Known maternity roosts and summer feeding areas in British Columbia are at elevations below 240 meters, known hibernation sites occur above 400 meters in caves over 100 meters long (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004). These bats have been observed foraging over hot spring pools and clearings above scrubby salal (<em>Gaultheria shallon</em>).","Habitat quantity and quality are presumed to be declining (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004), but the rate of decline is unknown. Population estimates made at a British Columbia maternity colony during the 1990s indicate that it remained stable between 1991 and 2000 (COSEWIC 2003).<br/><br/>Logging activities and associated road building likely are reducing and fragmenting habitat, mineral extraction, forest fires, and pesticides also may be detrimental (Balcombe, 1988 COSEWIC report, British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004). Disturbance during hibernation and while raising young is a major concern, disturbance may result from recreational activities (e.g., caving) or industrial activities (e.g., blasting for road construction) (British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection 2004). Current levels of timber harvest could have a detrimental effect on the Alaska population by altering forest structure important to bats  (Parker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997).

Approximately 50% of the global range of this small bat is found in eastern North America, subpopulations in these part of the range have been devastated by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease caused by an introduced pathogen. This disease was first detected in North America in 2006, and to date has caused &gt;90% overall decline in known numbers of hibernating <em>Myotis </em>bats in several areas of Canada and the US. The current range of the disease has been expanding at an average rate of 200-250 km per year. At that rate, the entire population is likely to be affected within 12 to 18 years. There is no apparent containment of the northward or westward spread of the pathogen, and proper growing conditions for it exist throughout the remaining range.","Little Brown Bats inhabit forested lands near water, but some subspecies can be found in dry climates where water is not readily available. In those habitats, drinking water is provided by moisture on cave walls or condensation on the fur. This species occurs over a wide latitudinal and elevational range, but tend to be more abundant in areas with suitable hibernation sites (Wilson and Ruff 1999). They feed mainly on aquatic insects such as caddis flies, mayflies and midges, sometimes, they eat mosquitoes too. This is a species most commonly found flying around houses in North America.<br/><br/>During the winter, hibernation time depends on altitude and location of  the roosts. It usually starts between September and November and ends in  March to May. They do not migrate long distances for hibernation  roosts. Individuals travel only up to 100 miles. This species does not show territoriality at roosts, and large colonies  of as many as 300,000 bats have been reported in a single roost (Barbour  and Davis 1969). The lifespan of this species is extended by their  ability to find food and inhabit a variety of roosts. These  characteristics allow expansion of their habitat to new ranges, but also  contribute to their survival.&#160;<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>&#160;lives  approximately 6 to 7 years and often live well beyond 10 years. A 31  year-old male was discovered in southeastern Ontario. Evidence indicates  that males tend to live longer than females (Humphrey and Cope 1976).","Major threats to this species at present include a fungal disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS) affecting hibernating colonies of several temperate bat species, that&#160;has devastated eastern North American bat populations at hibernation sites since 2007 (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010, BCI 2012).&#160;Wind power is another emerging threat to bats: wind turbines have been shown to fatally impact all bat species in Wisconsin (Arnett <em>et al</em>. 2008). Wind-turbine blades cause mortality through direct impact or through the pressure differential caused by the motion of the spinning blades. More research is under way to better understand bat wind-turbine vulnerabilities, but current studies suggest that bats face the greatest risk during migration from summer foraging sites to wintering grounds (tree bats) or hibernacula (cave bats) (Kunz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). Model predictions for <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> in northeastern US predict 99% probability of functional extirpation by 2026. In addition, these bats use to inhabit attics, roofs, trees, and other areas in close proximity to humans, therefore, homeowners have spent large amounts of money trying to eradicate <em>M. lucifugus</em> from these areas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).","Population size is unknown but <em>M. lucifugus</em> was likely over six million prior to the 2007 arrival of White-nose Syndrome (WNS) to America (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). As of 2006, regional mean growth suggested that the northeastern core population of this species was stable or slightly increasing (Frick <em>et al.</em> 2010b), and, pre-WNS population of this species was viable and did not face imminent risk of extinction. This species was considered to be common in much of their range in eastern Canada and northeastern US (Wilson and Ruff 1999), and is still common in Canada outside the range of WNS.&#160;Mortality rates at some hibernation sites have been as high as 90% (BCI 2012).&#160;As emerging science has confirmed, the best available evidence conservatively predicts a 99% chance of Little Brown Bat extinction in the northeastern U.S. by at least 2026, and potentially much sooner depending on the actualized mortality rates that result as the disease continues its rapid spread (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"<em>Myotis lucifugus</em> is found from Alaska (USA) to Labrador and Newfoundland (Canada), south to Southern California, Northern Arizona, Northern New Mexico (USA) (Simmons 2005).

In southern British Columbia, long-eared myotis roost in tree cavities in dense forests. In adapting to forest management in certain areas of British Columbia, they have recently been found to roost in the stumps of clear-cut stands. Long-eared myotis prefer the stumps of ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine in these areas.

Some bats require stable, highly insulated environments in order to hibernate. <em>Eptesicus fuscus</em> has a more tolerant constitution so it can winter in less substantial structures. Besides human dwellings, it has been found to take up residence in barns, silos, and churches. Also, this bat has been found roosting in storm sewers, expansion joint spaces in concrete athletic stadiums, and copper mines (Baker 1983). In pre-settlement times it is presumed the big brown bat roosted in tree hollows, natural caves, or openings in rock ledges. Occasionally groups of these bats are still found living in tree cavities (Baker 1983). Recently, some were found hibernating in caves in Minnesota (Knowles 1992).<br/>The big brown bat hibernates in various structures, either man-made or natural environments. They prefer cool temperatures and can tolerate conditions many other bats cannot. They may become active during their winter hibernacula and can move to an optimum habitat. One banded bat was recorded to have moved to a different cave 400 yards away, during the same winter (Goehring 1972).<br/><em>Eptesicus fuscus</em> is an insectivorous bat. It preys primarily on beetles using its robust skull and powerful jaws to chew through the beetles' hard chitinous exoskeleton. It also eats other flying insects including moths, flies, wasps, flying ants, lacewing flies, and dragonflies (Baker 1983). One study indicated that juvenile <em>E. fuscus</em> ate a greater range of softer food items in their diets, compared to adults. The same study also indicated that bats having survived their first winter (yearlings), did not differ significantly in diet from the adults (Hamilton and Barclay 1998).",Big Brown Bats are fairly common and are not of any special conservation concern.,It is reasonable to speculate that populations of the big brown bat have increased with an increasing number of human habitations (Baker 1983). Big brown bats can survive up to 19 years in the wild and males tend to live longer than females. Most big brown bats die in their first winter. If they do not store enough fat to make it through their entire hibernation period then they die in their winter roost. Female big brown bats form maternity colonies to rear young. The size of these colonies can vary from 5 to 700 animals. Males of the species roost alone or in small groups during this time. Both sexes will roost together again in the late summer (Nowak 1999).,Increasing,"The Big Brown bat is found from southern Canada to Colombia and Venezuela; Greater Antilles; Bahamas; Hispaniola, Dominica and Barbados (Lesser Antilles), also in Alaska (Simmons 2005).

The typical day roost for the bat is behind loose tree bark. These bats appear to be particularly fond of willow, maple and ash trees (most likely due to the deeply fissured bark). Hollow snags and bird nests also provide daytime roosting areas for silver-haired bats. Less common daytime roosts include buildings, such as open sheds and garages; however, due to their solitary nature and adaptation to woodland roosts, these bats rarely invade buildings in large enough numbers to cause alarm. During the winter months, silver-haired bats that hibernate find shelter in northern areas inside trees, buildings, rock crevices, and similar protected structures (Kunz 1982, Wilson and Ruff 1999).<br/>Silver-haired bats are insectivorous. Their diet mainly consists of flies, beetles, and moths. However, these bats feed opportunistically on any concentration of insects they come across. They have a short-range foraging strategy, traveling over woodland ponds and streams. Silver-haired bats do not always feed in mid-flight; they have been caught in mouse traps, suggesting ground foraging, and they have been reported to consume larvae on trees (Kunz 1982). Silver-haired bats have been reported to be one of the earliest fliers in the evening, sometimes appearing in broad daylight. However, other sources claim that these bats show nightly foraging activity, with one peak of activity before midnight and another before sunrise. The flying time of silver-haired bats is believed to be adjusted by the bat so that it will not conflict with the flying times of the red, hoary, or big brown bats (Kunz 1982, Wilson and Ruff 1999).During the summer, the bats are believed to segregate by sex. During late summer and autumn, however, silver-haired bats join in groups containing both sexes to migrate to the southern parts of their range (Van Gelder and Wingate 1961). Some individuals are also known to hibernate in the northern locations (Kunz 1982). Courtship and mating of silver-haired bats occurs in autumn when both sexes congregate for migration. Fertilization is delayed until the next spring. Births occur after a gestation period of 50 to 60 days. Two young are produced, usually between late June and early July (Kunz 1982).","Silver-haired Bats have no special endangered or threatened status; however, activities such as logging and deforestation may pose a threat for the bat in the future, by reducing roosting sites available (Kunz 1982).","During warm months, individuals and small groups can be found roosting in hollow trees, beneath exfoliating bark, and sometimes beneath rocks.

Depending on the location, they will either dig burrows into waterside banks, or construct houses of vegetation. Houses are built so that the main chambers are above water level, but can only be entered through underwater tunnels. Separate structures are constructed for feeding and nesting (Feldhamer, 1999 in Wilson and Ruff, 1999). Muskrats exhibit many morphological adaptations for aquatic life, including lips that close behind incisors to allow gnawing under water, partially webbed hindfeet, and the ability to stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Muskrats are primarily herbivorous, feeding on aquatic vegetation such as cattails and horsetails. During periods of food scarcity, individuals will also consume animal matter such as mussels, turtles, mice, birds, frogs and fish (Wilner <em>et al.</em>&#160;1980)","The majority of muskrat mortality is caused by humans. Muskrats are extensively trapped for their pelts, which are of increasing economic value around the world. High population densities of muskrats often result in destruction of local habitat, including damage to river banks caused by burrowing, and the reduction of aquatic vegetation due to over consumption for food and building materials. As a result, muskrats are often treated as a pest species and are trapped, hunted or poisoned to control population levels.","The muskrat is common to abundant in suitable habitats, with average densities of 40 individuals per hectare (Feldhamer, 1999 in Wilson and Ruff, 1999).",Stable,"This species occurs in North America, from northern Canada and Alaska south through the United States, except the arid regions of the southwest and Texas, and the Florida peninsula.

As such, we performed assessments for each of the seven subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Due to this speciesâ geographically widespread distribution, Criterion A was the only appropriate criterion for assessment that could be applied to the global Leatherback population. Generation length was estimated as 30 years. Estimation of global population change based on subpopulation trends (weighted by subpopulation sizes relative to the global population size) produced an estimate of -40.1% decline over the past three generations (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material), corresponding to a category of <em>Vulnerable based on Criterion A2 (i.e., threats are not reversible nor have they ceased), subcriteria b (i.e., an index of abundance appropriate to the taxonâannual nest countsâwas used) and d (i.e., decline was due to actual or potential levels of exploitation)</em>. In contrast, assessment of the data under Criterion A4âpast, present, and future abundanceârevealed that the global Leatherback population trends over three generations will no longer meet thresholds for threat categories by 2020 (-29.4%), and will be increasing by 2030 (3%) and beyond (104% by 2040) (see Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Therefore, within the next ten years, the global Leatherback population might no longer qualify as âThreatenedââi.e. a category listing of Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangeredâaccording to the IUCN Red List Criteria.</p><p>	However, future population increases will be dependent on the success of conservation actions mitigating current and future threats to this species throughout its range, especially in breeding and foraging areas, and on no new threats arising (e.g. climate change) that could cause population declines. Moreover, nearly 99% of the global population (based on data available currently) will be contained within the Northwest Atlantic, which obscures the declines of the Pacific subpopulations and threatened status of other relatively small subpopulations (e.g. Southwest Atlantic, Southwest Indian) (see Figure 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), not to mention data deficient subpopulations (Northeast Indian, Southeast Atlantic). While these results demonstrate that Leatherbacks, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Leatherback population. For this reason, the subpopulation-level Red List assessments for Leatherbacks should be given priority in evaluating the true global extinction risk for this species.<br/><br/><em>Justification</em></p>  <p>Comprehensive analyses of 39 existing datasetsâincluding 28 time series datasets with â¥10 years of dataâof abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities on beaches revealed different population trends among subpopulations, but a global decline overall based on subpopulation trends weighted by subpopulation size three generations ago relative to combined global population size (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;for all datasets used). Overall, considering only datasets with â¥10 yr of abundance data, the total global abundance across Leatherback subpopulations had declined from 90,599 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to 54,262 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> over three generations until 2010. Using average conversion factors from different subpopulations to provide bracketed estimates of nesting female abundance (i.e. 5 and 7 clutches per female, three years for re-migration intervals, intermediate between subpopulation averages; TEWG 2007, Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), these annual nesting abundance values correspond to approximately 12,943-18,120 nesting females yr<sup>-1 </sup>(or 38,828-54,359 adult females) three generations ago and 7,752-10,852 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> (or 23,255-32,557 adult females) in 2010. Because we did not include abundance data from several rookeries that had &lt;10 yr of dataâincluding Gabon, which is the largest Leatherback rookery in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), as well as Grand Riviere and Fishing Pond, Trinidad, Armila, Panama, and Gulf of UrubÃ¡, Colombia (TEWG 2007, PatiÃ±o-MartÃ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2008)âin our annual and total abundance subpopulation and global abundance estimates, these values should be considered conservative estimates.</p>  <p>Overall, although the global listing for Leatherbacks was derived by abundance-weighted analyses of three-generation trends for all subpopulations with available data, it is not an appropriate representation of conservation status of biologically relevant population units (i.e. subpopulations) that make up the global Leatherback population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by the Red List Categories), but also in how categories were derived for each subpopulation (as indicated by the Red List Criteria used) (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Specifically, final threat categories were triggered by thresholds under different criteria, depending on whether a subpopulation has declined significantly over time (e.g. East Pacific, West Pacific), was geographically constrained (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean), or characterized by small (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean) or very small population sizes (e.g. Southwest Atlantic Ocean). Therefore, the variation in conservation status among subpopulations warrants preference for subpopulation assessments over the global assessment when evaluating and describing the global conservation status of Leatherbacks.</p>  <p>Presently, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulationâi.e. from Florida, USA throughout the Wider Caribbeanâis large and increasing (TEWG 2007) (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the Southeast Atlantic subpopulationâi.e. West Africa, especially Gabonâis the largest in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), but long-term trend data are not available for this assessment (TEWG 2007). The existence of these large (and increasing in at least one case) subpopulations makes it extremely unlikely that Leatherbacks globally will go extinct in the near future. If current trends in the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation continue, the global population trend might no longer meet thresholds for IUCN Threatened categories (i.e., Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) within ten years (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). In fact, if current trends continue, future global population sizes are projected to increase to 184,662 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (approximately 26,380-36,932 females yr<sup>-1</sup>, 79,141-110,797 adult females total) within one generation (i.e. by 2040). The projected abundance of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone will account for nearly 99% of the global Leatherback population abundance by that time (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), and increase from 46% of historical global population abundance three generations ago.</p>  <p>In spite of the large and increasing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, the magnitudes of declines for the East Pacific subpopulation (i.e., which nests along the Pacific coast of the Americas) and, to a slightly lesser extent, the West Pacific subpopulation (i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands) over three generations were the main driver the global decline result. Specifically, the East Pacific subpopulation has declined by <em>&gt; </em>97% over three generations (from &gt;35,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt;1,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, or &gt;5,000 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt; 140 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, SantidriÃ¡n Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti MartÃ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2007), and its historic abundance accounted for roughly 39% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Similarly, the West Pacific subpopulation has declined &gt;80% over three generations, from &gt;12,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (2,600 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) to &lt;2,200 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (&lt;500 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, Chan and Liew 1996, Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2007, Hitipeuw <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013), and its historic abundance accounted for 14% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago. Both of these subpopulations are projected to decline further in coming decades (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Population declines in these subpopulations (and others) have been attributed to extensive egg harvest and mortality due to incidental capture in fishing gear (Eckert 1993, Wallace and Saba 2009, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Considering the precedent of the collapse of the historically large Pacific subpopulations, the persistence of significant threats in all regions (see Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review) warrants concern for the future viability of even the largest subpopulations. Current efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats must be maintainedâor even augmented, where possibleâto reverse declines in Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations and to sustain population growth in the Northwest Atlantic.</p>  <p>To explore future projections of Leatherback subpopulation and global abundance and trends, we also applied Criterion A4, which analyzes the global population trend within time intervals from the past, present, and future (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because the length of three generations (~90 yr) was greater than the length of our available datasets, we used the historical abundance values shown in Tables 3 and 4 (see&#160;Supplementary Material) as the baseline population sizes for âmoving windowâ analyses. According to our assessment of the data under Criterion A4, it would no longer qualify as âThreatenedâ according to IUCN Red List Criteria by 2020 (three-generation decline of 29.4%), and would qualify as Least Concern by 2030 (3% increase) under IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011) (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This discrepancy between A4 and A2 illustrates a dichotomy in how extinction risk is assessed by these two criteria, despite the same empirical data being used for assessments. Whereas A2 assesses percent decline over time, using the historical abundance as the baseline, A4 uses historical as well as current abundance to project future abundance, and as such accounts for recent growth in subpopulations in the global population estimate. Because the IUCN Guidelines stipulate that multiple criteria be evaluated, the criterion that triggers the highest threat category must be selected for the official assessment. Therefore, Leatherbacks globally are considered <em>Vulnerable (A2b,d)</em> based on IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011). </p>  <p>Nonetheless, these results further illustrate the inability of the global assessment to adequately characterize variation among subpopulations. The likelihood of global extinction of this species is extremely low (Tables 2 and 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material); however, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone is projected to account for nearly 99% of total global Leatherback abundance by 2040, with four other subpopulations for which data were available for this assessment accounting for the remaining 1% (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Such a global assessment produces a result indicating no risk of species-level extinction based on the mere existence of any Leatherback subpopulation, while obscuring the dire conservation situation of declining or extinct subpopulations (e.g., the Pacific subpopulations). This type of assessment and its result are contrary to the <a href=""http://iucn-mtsg.org/about/vision-mission/"">IUCN SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Groupâs (MTSG) mission</a> to guide conservation of marine turtles and their ecological roles. For these reasons, the MTSG defined subpopulations (i.e., regional management units; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) for all marine turtle species, including Leatherbacks, to provide a biologically described framework for evaluating conservation status of appropriate population segments. A global marine turtle population is an amalgam of its subpopulations, all of which are valuable for maintaining the health of the âspeciesâ in terms of evolutionary history, genetic diversity, and life history variations. For these reasons, the inability of marine turtle global assessments to appropriately account for variation among subpopulations (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review) further supports the primacy of subpopulation assessments when describing conservation status of marine turtles globally.</p>  <p>Previous global Leatherback assessments (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996), including the previous Leatherback Red List assessment (Sarti Martinez 2000), also described global declines in Leatherbacks. However, these previous assessments lacked the geographic breadth and rigour of time series datasets accessed for the current assessment. Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) estimated the global Leatherback population in 1995 to be approximately 34,500 adult females (range: 26,200-42,900 females), and stated that this value was roughly a third of the only existing global estimate at the time (115,000 adult females; Pritchard 1982). However, there were several significant assumptions in the Pritchard (1982) estimate that make its use as a reliable global population estimate tenuous, not the least of which was the lack of robust, nesting beach-based estimates of the East Pacific subpopulation abundance on which the regional and global estimates were constructed (see Mrosovsky 2003 for review). Sarti Martinez (2000) assessed the global Leatherback population as Critically Endangered largely on the evidence of significant declines in the East Pacific subpopulation (based on the Pritchard [1982] and Spotila <em>et al</em>. [1996] estimates) and Malaysian rookery, despite some indications of large populations in other regions, such as the Northwest and Southeast Atlantic.</p>  <p>In addition, abundance of several rookeries has increased substantially in the time since these assessments were conducted. For example, estimates for Trinidad, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, and Florida used by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) were all substantially lowerâby an order of magnitude in some casesâthan current estimates (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the current assessment only included time series datasets of a decade or longer in abundance estimates, whereas Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) included abundance estimates based on variable numbers of nesting seasons. The 2010 abundance estimates presented in the current assessment are generally lower, but overlap with the 1995 range in estimated abundance reported by Spotila et al. (1996). If abundance estimates from all rookeries with available nesting data (e.g. Panama [~8,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Colombia [2,300 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Trinidad [&gt;40,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, and especially Gabon [36,185-126,480 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>]; Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material) were included in the 2010 assessment, the total global abundance of Leatherbacks in 2010 would be much higher than the estimate shown in Table 3, and would exceed the average estimate of Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996). However, this is not necessarily indicative of a global population increase, but rather an increase in available information. Therefore, given the availability of new datasets from all Leatherback subpopulations globally, use of previous estimates (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996) to characterize global Leatherback population abundance is no longer appropriate.</p>  <p>Interpreting the current assessment (2010) in the context of previous assessments and available data at present, the global Leatherback population has not collapsed, and, in fact, appears to be larger than estimated in previous global assessments (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996). This result appears counter-intuitive with the <em>Vulnerable</em> category to which this subpopulation has been assigned, but it can be traced to the nature of the procedure for applying Criterion A to long-lived, widely distributed species like marine turtles (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). The change in IUCN Red List Category from <em>Critically Endangered</em> (in 2000) to <em>Vulnerable</em> (assessment year 2010) is mostly due to new datasets made available for assessment, and associated detection of increasing trends that were not reported previously, as well as a rigorous application of the IUCN 3.1 Criteria. The continued severe declines of the Pacific subpopulations require urgent and effective conservation interventions to prevent complete collapse (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 2000, SantidriÃ¡n Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti MartÃ­nez <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, the projected increase in the global population is predicated entirely on continued growth of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone, which itself depends on sustained conservation efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats.</p>  <p><em>Assessment Procedure:</em></p>  <p>Given the widespread, long-lived nature of Leatherback turtles, Criterion A (i.e., decline in population of mature individuals over time) is the only appropriate criterion that could be used for this assessment; the restricted geographic range and small population size criteria (Criterion B, C, and D) did not apply, and no population viability analysis was available (Criterion E). However, Criteria A-D were applied in subpopulation assessments (see Leatherback subpopulation assessments for details; Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material).</p>  <p>We obtained time series datasets of abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities collected on Leatherback rookeries (i.e., nesting beaches) around the world, and organized data by subpopulations. For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (NRC 2010). Conversion from number of nests to number of nesting females requires estimates of clutch frequency (i.e. number of clutches per nesting female per breeding season) (e.g. Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), which are not available for all rookeries and subpopulations. Therefore, we presented and analysed all abundance data in numbers of confirmed nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, as this metric was the most commonly available (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). See <em>Sources of Uncertainty</em> for discussion of caveats associated with these conversion factors.</p>  <p>We calculated annual and overall population trends for each rookery within a subpopulation, and then calculated average subpopulation trends by weighting rookery population trends by rookery abundance 3 generations ago relative to subpopulation abundance three generations ago. We then repeated this step to derive the global population trend by weighting subpopulation trends by subpopulation abundance three generations ago relative to global abundance three generations ago (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). We only included time series datasets of â¥10 yr in trend estimations, although we included all rookeries for which we obtained abundance values in the overall summary tables (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because rookeries represent varying proportions of total subpopulation sizes, we ensured that time series from major rookeries within each subpopulation were included in analyses such that the majority of subpopulation abundance was represented. In cases where that was not possible (e.g. Southeast Atlantic, Northeast Indian), we did not derive a subpopulation trend, and such cases were excluded from calculation of global trends.</p>  <p>The most recent year for available abundance data across all rookeries and subpopulations was 2010. Where time series ended prior to 2010, we estimated population sizes for each rookery through 2010 based on the population trend for existing years (e.g. French Guiana, Trinidad). Furthermore, if a longer time series for a rookery within a subpopulation was available that reflected a trend not captured by shorter time series, we estimated historical abundance to calculate overall declines for that subpopulation. For example, abundance data for three of five index sites in the Mexican Pacificâthe East Pacific subpopulationâbegin in the early 1980s, while the remaining sites (i.e., Barra de la Cruz and CahuitÃ¡n, Oaxaca) begin in the early 1990s (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). All other sites in Mexico, as well as other sites within the same subpopulation (i.e., those in Costa Rica), showed a decline of &gt;97%, whereas the Barra de la Cruz and CahuitÃ¡n showed much less dramatic declines, because the time series began after the broader population decline had already begun to occur. Given the synchrony in inter-annual abundance fluctuations and historical reports of high abundance among these rookeries (Eckert 1993), we assumed that the abundance at Barra de la Cruz and CahuitÃ¡n was similar to that of other Mexican rookeries at the beginning of those time series, i.e., 1982 (L. Sarti MartÃ­nez pers. comm.). This allowed us to standardize trend and abundance estimates within the Mexican rookeries. &#160; &#160;</p>  <p>To apply Criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN 2011). In the case of the Leatherback, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 30 years (see below). For Criterion A2, data from three generations ago (~100 yr) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e. assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtlesâwith generation lengths of 30 yr or moreâare obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). Abundance data from ~100 yr ago are not available for Leatherbacks anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate&#160;because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations (~100 years, one generation estimated 30 yr; see below) ago was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply Criterion A to subpopulations (see separate subpopulation assessments) and the global population, we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations.<br/><br/>We also evaluated to the global population against Criterion A4 (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), using the same overall scheme as described above. Criterion A4 permits for analysis of population trend during a âmoving windowâ of time, i.e. over three generations, but where the time window must include the past, present, and future. Furthermore, multiple time-frames are to be examined, and the maximum decline calculated for a given time-frame is to be compared to the thresholds (IUCN 2011). Therefore, we made the same assumption about earliest available historical abundance being equivalent to the population abundance for generations past, and estimated future population abundance in 2020, 2030, and 2040, which all fall within the next generation (i.e., 30 yr). These future projections assume that the derived population trend will continue without deviation during the next generation. Implicit in this assumption is that no changes to degree of threats or conservation efforts impacting rookeries, subpopulations, or the global population will occur during that time. Based on available information, threats to Leatherbacks globally that have caused observed declines have not ceased and are not reversible (see Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review), making this a reasonable assumption in the absence of better information. The global population will no longer be âThreatenedâ according to IUCN Red List thresholds by 2020 (-29.4% decline over three generations), and will be increasing by 2030 (3% increase) and beyond (104% increase by 2040)âi.e. IUCN category of Near Threatened or Least Concernâaccording to Criterion A4, depending on the âtime windowâ applied (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This result is due mainly to the currently large and growing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, and in spite of the lack of sufficient information for the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation and the continued declines in the East Pacific and West Pacific subpopulations.<br/><br/><em>Estimating Generation Length:<br/><br/></em>Leatherback age at maturity is uncertain, and estimates range widely (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review). Reported estimates fall between 9-15 yr, based on skeletochronology (Zug and Parham 1996), and inferences from mark-recapture studies (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, updated skeletochronological analyses estimated Leatherback age at maturity to be between 26-32 yr (mean 29 yr) (Avens <em>et al</em>. 2009). Extrapolations of captive growth curves under controlled thermal and trophic conditions suggested that size at maturity could be reached in 7-16 yr (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011). Thus, a high degree of variance and uncertainty remains about Leatherback age at maturity in the wild. Likewise, Leatherback lifespan is unknown. Long-term monitoring studies of Leatherback nesting populations have tracked individual adult females over multiple decades (e.g. SantidriÃ¡n Tomillo&#160;<em>et al</em>. unpublished data, Nel and Hughes unpublished data), but precise estimates of reproductive lifespan and longevity for Leatherbacks are currently unavailable.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population; older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual (IUCN 2011). Thus, for the purposes of this assessment, we estimated generation length to be 30 yr, or equal to the age at maturity (estimated to be 20 yr on average), plus a conservative estimate of reproductive half-life of 10 yr, as assumed by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996).<br/><br/><em>Sources of Uncertainty:<br/><br/></em>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (NRC 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (NRC 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Leatherbacks, including age at maturity (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review), generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, re-migration intervals, etc.). These values can vary among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends (SWOT Scientific Advisory Board 2011). For example, monitoring effort on Matura beach, Trinidad, has changed multiple times since the early 1990s, which necessitated a modelling exercise to estimate a complete time series for years with reliable monitoring levels (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, there was a general lack of measures of variance around annual counts provided for the assessment, which could be erroneously interpreted as equally high confidence in all estimates. Measures of variance around annual counts would provide information about relative levels of monitoring effort within and among rookeries, and thus reliability of resulting estimates. For all of these reasons, results of this assessment of global population decline should be considered with caution. For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em>D. coriacea</em> is an oceanic, deep-diving marine turtle inhabiting tropical, subtropical, and subpolar seas. Leatherbacks make extensive migrations between different feeding areas at different seasons, and to and from nesting areas. Leatherbacks feed predominantly on jellyfishes, salps and siphonophores. Females usually produce several (3-10) clutches of 60-90 eggs in a reproductive season, and typically have a re-migration interval of multiple years (2+) between subsequent reproductive seasons. For a thorough review of Leatherback biology, please see Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012).</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>Threats to Leatherbacks vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Leatherbacks, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>.

(2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Leatherbacks globally, followed by human consumption of Leatherback eggs, meat, or other products, and coastal development. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Leatherbacksâand other marine turtle speciesâshould be a high priority for future conservation efforts.&#160;</p>","<p>Leatherbacks are a single species globally comprising seven biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010), which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. RMUs are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are seven Leatherback RMUs (hereafter subpopulations): Northwest Atlantic Ocean, Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Indian Ocean, Southwest Indian Ocean, East Pacific Ocean, and West Pacific Ocean (Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world (Dutton<em> et al</em>. 1999, 2013), and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace<em> et al</em>. 2010; shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Leatherbacks are distributed circumglobally, with nesting sites on tropical sandy beaches and foraging ranges that extend into temperate and sub-polar latitudes (see Figure 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;and global distribution map). See Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012) for review of Leatherback geographic range.&#160;<strong></strong></p>","Leatherback eggs and animals are taken for human use (i.e. consumption and commercial products), eggs are also eaten by domestic animals (e.g. dogs).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Leatherbacks are protected under various Conventions, national and international laws, treaties, agreements, and memoranda of understanding. A partial list of international conservation instruments that provide legislative protection for Leatherbacks are: Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); the Leatherbackâs inclusion in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS); the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC); the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA); the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection; and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.</p>  <p>Long-term efforts to reduce or eliminate threats to Leatherbacks on nesting beaches have been successful in many places (e.g. Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005, ChacÃ³n-Chaverri and Eckert 2007, SantidriÃ¡n Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti MartÃ­nez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007) but not all places (e.g. Chan and Liew 1996). Reducing Leatherback bycatch has become a primary focus for many conservation projects around the world, and some mitigation efforts are showing promise (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2005; Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2011). However, threats to Leatherbacksâbycatch mortality and egg consumption, in particularâpersist, and in some places, continue to hinder population recovery (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012; Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013; Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2013). For depleted Leatherback populations to recover, the most prevalent and impactful threats must be reduced wherever they occur, whether on nesting beaches or in feeding, migratory, or other habitats (Bellagio Report 2007; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013); a holistic approach that addresses threats at all life history stages needs to be implemented (Dutton and Squires 2011). Therefore, current conservation efforts, legal protections, and resources supporting those mechanisms must be maintainedâand augmented, wherever possibleâto reverse population declines and sustain stable and increasing population trends among Leatherback subpopulations. Regional and local efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats should be designed to address threats at appropriate scales, and implemented with participation of appropriate stakeholders.</p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45184315,41267,Ochotona princeps,Least Concern,,2016,2016-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Pikas are listed as Least Concern. The USFWS has issued a finding that the species is not Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Similarly, the California Fish and Game Commission has ruled twice that the pika not be considered Endangered under the stateâs Endangered Species Act. The only declines that have been adequately quantified (in the Great Basin): 1) do not include all the available pika habitat in the Great Basin (pikas exist in other mountain ranges and at higher and lower elevations than the targeted sites that were censused), 2) represent only a small fraction of all pika populations within the range of the species, and 3) still do not document (even within the region) the necessary 80-90% decline needed for an A criterion judgement. Additionally, a number of new low elevation (warm) localities have been identified recently, and evidence is accumulating that the pika is more resilient in the face of warming temperatures than previously thought.","The American Pika is a candidate indicator species for the effects of climate change (in particular, global warming, although interactions with precipitation and snowpack merit continuing attention), because it occurs in a very specific insular habitat type, has a very low reproductive rate (counterbalanced by being relatively long-lived for a small mammal), exhibits very limited dispersal ability, and is primarily diurnal and extremely sensitive to warm temperatures.<br/><br/>The American Pika is a typical rock-dwelling species of pika (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1990). It primarily inhabits talus and talus-like formations adjoining a meadow or source of vegetation in cool and moist microclimates across western North America (Smith and Weston 1990, Hafner 1994, Millar and Westfall 2010). Talus habitat is typically insular or patchy in nature at several spatial resolutions (Smith 1974a, Smith and Gilpin 1997). Pikas prefer talus in RIF (rock-ice-feature) formations (83% of sites in one study of 420 pika sites), and with rock diameters of 0.2-1.0 m (Tyser 1980, Hafner 1994, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2010, Millar and Westfall 2010). They may also occur in lava flows and anthropogenic habitats such as mine ore dumps or road cuts; occasionally they may live in piles of logs or similar habitat (Smith 1974a,b; Millar and Westfall 2010; Rodhouse <em>et al.</em> 2010; Manning and Hagar 2011).<br/><br/>American Pikas are individually territorial on talus habitat (as calculated above; at a density approximating 20 individuals per hectare). Pikas are relatively long-lived for a small mammal (120â175 g); some pikas may live to the age of 6 or 7 years, and many live to the age of 3-4 years (Millar and Zwickel 1972a; Smith 1978). The reproductive rate of American Pikas is low; females initiate two litters per year, although it is most common for only one litter to be weaned successfully (Smith 1978; Smith and Ivins 1983a; Smith and Weston 1990). Average litter size at time of parturition ranges from 2.3â3.7 (range 1â5 young), although there is an erosion of fecundity during weaning such that most females only successfully wean two (or at the most three) young per year (Smith 1978; Smith and Weston 1990). Mortality rate is highest in the juvenile age class (Millar and Zwickel 1972a; Smith 1978). Juveniles must claim a vacant territory to survive the winter, and in saturated populations availability of vacant territories is contingent on the low mortality rate of adults (Smith 1978; Smith and Ivins 1983b).<br/><br/>In ecological studies where pikas have been individually marked, American Pikas have consistently been found to be poor dispersers (Tapper 1973, Smith and Ivins 1983b, Smith 1987, Peacock 1997). It is rare for an adult to disperse; once settled on a territory, they tend to remain there for life (the occasional dispersal movement by an adult is to move to a vacant site adjoining its home territory if it is of substantially higher quality; Smith and Ivins 1983b; Smith 1987). Juveniles tend to remain philopatric, largely occupying space in the interstices between adult territories. Juveniles also time-share activity periods with resident adults; they are primarily active when adults are inactive. This strategy ensures that juveniles are familiar with a region of talus so that they can claim any territory vacancy that may appear (Smith and Ivins 1983, 1987; Tapper 1973; Smith 1987). As a result, few juveniles attempt to disperse away from their birthplace. When juveniles attempt to disperse within a talus patch, they are socially rebuked by non-parental adults; when they leave a patch in an attempt to find available talus elsewhere, they increase their exposure to predators and are unable to use the safety of the talus to cool themselves if the ambient conditions are too warm (Smith 1974b, Smith and Ivins 1983, Smith 1987). Ability of juveniles to engage in long-distance (intra-patch) dispersal appears related to temperature. At low elevations dispersal distance and probability of success are low (Smith 1974 a,b; Peacock and Smith 1997; Smith and Gilpin 1997). Most observed long-distance dispersal has occurred at higher elevations where the talus tends to be more continuous and it is cooler (Tapper 1973; Smith 1974 a,b; Smith 1987; Peacock 1997). An understanding of pika dispersal is necessary because most observed pika population extirpations have occurred at low (hot) elevations, and it is under these conditions that probability of subsequent re-colonization of these sites is extremely low. When a high-elevation population temporarily disappears, its chance of being recolonized is significantly greater (Tapper 1973, Smith 1987).<br/><br/>Pikas are very sensitive to warm or hot temperatures; when daytime temperatures are hot during summer, they tend to avoid the warmer temperatures and concentrate their activity at dawn and dusk (MacArthur and Wang 1974, Smith 1974b). Under these conditions, they may even exhibit nocturnal behaviour (Smith 1974b). Pikas have a relatively high body temperature and a relatively low upper lethal temperature; thus, they have very little flexibility with regard to physiological temperature regulation. Field experiments have shown that when confined in the sun and unable to behaviourally thermoregulate (such as by darting into the interstices of the talus where it is always significantly cooler), they can die at relatively low ambient temperatures (25.5 â 29.4oC)(MacArthur and Wang 1973, 1974; Smith 1974b). This temperature sensitivity puts dispersing pikas, particularly at lower, warmer elevations, at increased risk and is why restricted dispersal distances under these conditions are most commonly observed (Smith 1974a,b). Relative vulnerability of pika populations to climatic stress may be indexed by variables such as latitude and elevation, two factors known to affect local climate and, in turn, the distribution of American Pikas (Grinnell 1917, Smith 1974a, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pikas are generalized herbivores. As the American Pika does not hibernate, it must collect food during summer that it stores in a haypile or cache in the talus to serve as food during winter. Thus, during the summer the pika has two distinctly different foraging strategies: the direct consumption of food and haying behaviour (Huntly <em>et al.</em> 1986). Haying reaches a crescendo in mid-late summer; during this time a pika may make hundreds of trips each day off the talus to clip and harvest plants for its haypile (Smith and Ivins 1984). The plants available to a pika to eat or hay are restricted to the vegetation on or adjoining its territory. Pikas are highly selective of which plants they consume or harvest, choosing plants that are higher in water content, protein, and select micronutrients (West 1981, Millar and Zwickel 1972b) and other characteristics (reviewed in Smith and Weston 1990). The timing of haying is related to the phenology of plants at any given altitude (that is, they begin and end this activity earlier at lower elevations), gender (males generally initiate haying earlier) and age (adults begin haying before juveniles) (Smith 1974b, Smith and Weston 1990).","The most pervasive threat affecting the American Pika appears to be contemporary climate change. While the species as a whole is Least Concern, large tracts of its extent of occurrence (EOO)ânamely across the Great Basin â have seen local population extirpations, range contractions (upslope movement of the lower-elevation range boundary), and reduced densities (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2010, 2011; Wilkening <em>et al.</em> 2011). Three alternative classes of direct thermal stresses may affect the persistence of pika populations (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2010): 1) acute cold stress (number of days below a very cold threshold temperature); 2) acute heat stress (number of days above a warm threshold temperature; and 3) chronic heat stress (such as average summer temperature). Acute cold stress may arise from reduced snowpack (observed across western North America; Mote <em>et al.</em> 2005) which in turn may result from more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, or warmer days leading to a more rapid melt-off of snowpack, or both. Without the snowpack that acts as an insulator during winter, pikas might freeze or extinguish their food supplies while attempting to thermoregulate leading to an increase in mortality (Smith 1978, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2010). While some areas have extant populations at higher elevations to and from which pikas could disperse, the insular nature of talus habitat means that many populations that become extirpated will remain so on an ecological time scale â the likelihood of recolonization is extremely remote. While extinctions in the Great Basin have been going on for a long time (~7,500 years), the recent rate is high and indicative of observed increases in temperature in the region due to climate change (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Current American Pika distributions in the Great Basin represent a perfect storm generated by the high temperatures (in summer) and reduced snowpack (in winter; Mote <em>et al.</em> 2005) caused by climate change.<br/><br/>A counterbalance to the data accumulated in the Great Basin is the population of pikas at Bodie, California, at about 2,550 m elevation just 35 km west of the Sierra Nevada crest where summer temperatures are relatively warm. There pikas occupy insular patches of habitat (ore dumps left by mining activity) that are spaced across a landscape of Great Basin shrub vegetation. This classic metapopulation, the longest-term study of any pika species, has been observed since the late 1940s (Severaid 1955) and semi-continuously since 1969 (Smith 1974 a, b, 1978, 1980; Smith and Gilpin 1997), including annual censuses (with a couple of two-year gaps) from 1989 to 2010 (Smith unpublished data). Approximately 78 ore dump patches have been included in each census. In 1991 the southern half of the figure-eight-shaped study area experienced a meta-population collapse and has not recovered (Smith and Gilpin 1987); in 2010 the southern constellation of patches was still void of pikas. However, the 37 patches in the northern constellation showed a slightly higher occupancy rate in 2009 (84%; the lowest percent occupancy was 49% in the north) than in the first full census in 1972. Thus, there appears to be no evidence that heat stress in summer at Bodie causes mortality or population decline of pikas on these small habitat islands, although warm temperatures may have inhibited colonization of the southern constellation.<br/><br/>Another largely Great Basin threat is competition with free-ranging and feral cattle in those situations where livestock are allowed to graze within the typical pika foraging distance from the talus margin (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2003). Most pikas live in cattle-free areas or, in Colorado, grazing temporally occurs primarily in fall after pikas have completed their haypiles. But in the Great Basin cattle graze adjoining many of the limited pika populations. Beever <em>et al.</em> (2003) noted that cattle grazing could be contributory to some pika population extirpations. Pika density was lower in areas that were heavily grazedâprimarily small sites with more edge compounding the effect of grazing (Beever unpublished data). Further, presence of livestock grazing increased in importance from the 20th century observations to the 1999-2008 observation period in terms of predicting the pattern of site-level persistence of pikas in the Great Basin (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Millar (in press) has compared placement of pika haypiles in Great Basin ranges at sites with and without cattle grazing. Normally, pikas place their haypiles close to the talus/vegetation interface; at her cattle-free sites this distance averaged 1.8 m from the talus edge. At grazed sites pikas placed their haypiles an average of 30 m upslope from the talus edge and were forced to forage on comparatively poor vegetation growing amidst the rocks. Millar concluded that grazing effects could be contributing to observed regional differences in viability of pikas.","American Pikas are individually territorial (male and female territories are of approximately similar sizes; Smith and Ivins 1984) on a very discrete and identifiable habitat type, talus or piles of broken rock. Although territory size may vary seasonally and by habitat quality, a rough average from several detailed studies (reviewed in Smith and Weston 1990) is approximately 500 mÂ². This size also roughly corresponds to the area as determined by the average nearest-neighbour distance (diameter of a pika territory; area determined by ÏrÂ²) between centres of activity of individuals (basically, the average distance between haypiles; Smith and Weston 1990). Thus in prime talus habitat, about 20 pikas may occur per hectare.<br/><br/>As highlighted in the discussion of Distribution (above), pika populations are declining in some parts of the speciesâ geographic range, primarily at low elevations in the Great Basin (populations being lost, and other populations shifting their distribution upslope). From everything we know about pika biology (thermally sensitive) and dispersal ability (extremely limited, especially in warm environments; MacArthur and Wang 1973, 1974; Smith 1974a,b), it is unlikely that any of these lost populations can be resettled within ecological time â thus they represent a loss and we conclude that the global population is decreasing.",Decreasing,"The American Pika has a widespread, but discontinuous geographic distribution throughout mountainous areas of western United States and southwestern Canada (British Columbia and Alberta) (Smith and Weston 1990, Hafner and Smith 2010). The accompanying range map demarcates the five recognized subspecies (Hafner and Smith 2010).<br/><br/>There is paleontological evidence that supports a past distribution that once included now-uninhabited, low-lying regions of the Great Basin and other parts of North America (Mead 1987, Hafner 1993, Grayson 2005). Following Brown's (1971, 1978) suggested mechanism of Holocene extinctions after a period of colonization during the Pleistocene, Grayson (1987, 2005) and Mead (1987) concluded that the American Pika became extinct from low-lying regions in the Great Basin between 7,500 and 5,000 B.P. The current discontinuous distribution, however, is not supported by a colonization-driven system (Brown 1971, 1978; Beever <em>et al.</em> 2003; Smith 1974a). Elevational distribution varies with latitude. Pikas may live from close to sea level (for example, the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon, Simpson 2009) to 3,000 m in the northern extent of their range (Smith and Weston 1990). In the southern-most portions of their range they only occasionally extend below 2,500 m and are known to occupy sites as high as 3,887 m in the White Mountains, California, and 3,786 in the Sierra Nevada, California (Smith and Weston 1990, Millar and Westfall 2010).&#160; Pikas have been reported to occur as high as 4,146 m on Wheeler Peak, New Mexico (Howell 1924) and 4,175 m on Mt. Evans and Pikeâs Peak, Colorado (Markham and Whicker 1973, Erb pers. comm.). There are numerous locations where pikas persist in what would appear to be climatically marginal sites, such as:&#160; Lava Beds National Monument, California, Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho, the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon (where they are found as low as 30 m in elevation), the western Cascade Range, Oregon, and select localities throughout the Great Basin (Howell 1924, Horsfall 1925, Anthony 1928, Beever 2002, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2008, Simpson 2009, Millar and Westfall 2010, Rodhouse <em>et al.</em> 2010, Manning and Hagar 2011). Persistence of American Pikas in these localities appears to reflect a strong decoupling of microclimates used by pikas (which are notably temperature sensitive, see Habitats and Ecology, below) from the macroclimate of the region.<br/><br/>In contrast to recent findings of pikas at atypical low-elevation areas, other studies have documented extirpations of pikas on a number of historically occupied low-elevation sites throughout the Great Basin. Surveys conducted from 1994-1999 in the Great Basin found that six of 25 historical American Pika localities (records of occurrence documented from 1898-1956) appeared to be extirpated (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2003). Follow-up surveys conducted from 2003-2008 documented three additional extirpations and one site that appeared functionally extirpated (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011). This rapid and accelerating rate of extirpation has been accompanied by an upslope movement of the low-elevation range boundary of pikas on extant sites in the Great Basin, and taken together these shifts appear to be driven by contemporary climate change (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011; Wilkening <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent surveys of historical sites in regions other than the Great Basin have also noted some extirpations, albeit at a smaller proportion of sites. For example, Erb <em>et al.</em> (in press) sampled 69 historical sites in the southern Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to Wyoming, including the lowest elevation sites within regions, and documented four extirpations (and two of these sites were subsequently recolonized (Erb pers. comm). The Grinnell resurvey in Yosemite National Park, California, found a single extirpation of a pika population along a transect from the eastern to the western extent of the Sierra Nevada (Moritz <em>et al.</em> 2008). Numerous inventories and surveys are currently underway to document the extent of the speciesâ distribution across the geographic range of the American Pika and the status and trend of pika populations with regard to factors associated with contemporary climate change.","The American Pika is not utilized or involved in trade of any sort. Its primary economic importance is as a focus for ecotourism; thus, it may support livelihoods of local people.",Terrestrial,"<ul><li>Pikas occur in many national parks and other protected areas throughout their range in the United States and Canada. Pikas tend to occupy areas away from human habitations or influence, and they appear to not be negatively influenced by trails or nearby roads that do encroach on their habitat (for example, they often colonize road cuts (Manning and Hagar 2011, Millar and Smith pers. obs). Neither hunting nor trapping of American Pikas is allowed throughout their range.</li><li>Additional research on the potential competitive relationship between livestock grazing and pikas in the Great Basin should be initiated, and if it is shown that competition between pikas and livestock occurs and increases the probability of local extirpation of Great Basin pika populations, management plans should be enacted to eliminate grazing in areas adjoining known pika populations.</li><li>The American Pika should be considered an early-warning indicator species for the effects of climate change and continuously monitored throughout their range to demonstrate how a species with these attributes could adapt and be resilient in the face of climate change, or to determine their decline and how it could be reversed.

Populations seem to be healthy, overall, although there exists some concern over range contractions, especially in the southeastern USA. The status of distinct subspecies along the Pacific coast is unclear.","<p>The Snowshoe Hare<em> </em>is associated with boreal and mixed deciduous forest of North America. It requires mixed forest with dense understory, which it uses as cover. Summer pelage is always brown; winter pelage color depends on snow duration and ephemerality and is white in most of the range, with winter brown morphs found in &lt;10% of the range almost all within a narrow strip along the maritime western Pacific coast of North America (Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018, Nagorsen 1983). Typically, stands aged 25-40 years are ideal. The Snowshoe Hare also seems to favor edge habitat. Diet consists mostly of grasses, forbs, sedges, and ferns (Murray 2003, Krebs and Murray 2018).<br/> <br/> The total length of Snowshoe Hares is 36.0 - 52.0 cm (Banfield 1974, Hall 1981). Their breeding season extends from March to September and is subject to photoperiod and hormonal control (Murray 2003, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2018). The average number of litters varies according to location with 1.9 litters per year in Alaska and 3.8 litters per year in Wisconsin (Murray 2003). Litter size varies according to location and number of previous litters produced (Murray 2003).</p>","Southern populations may be subject to excessive habitat loss and  fragmentation, perhaps climate change plays a contributory role as well  (Sultaire <em>et al.</em> 2016, Zimova <em>et al.</em> 2016, Mills <em>et al.</em> 2018).","Populations of Snowshoe Hares are more or less continuous in Canada and Alaska, although patchily distributed in the contiguous USA. Populations in the boreal forest fluctuate according to a 10-year cycle, where their densities may vary 100-fold over the span of several years. Southern populations may be noncyclic or fluctuate with reduced amplitude (Krebs and Murray 2018, Krebs <em>et al.</em> Boutin 2018). This extreme local fluctuation in density makes it difficult to portray a single population level for Snowshoe Hares.<br/> <br/> Some evidence supports contractions across the southern range periphery (Diefenbach <em>et al. </em>2016, Sultaire <em>et al.</em> 2016). This may be related to habitat loss and increases in generalized predator (especially Coyote <em>Canis latrans</em>) numbers. Climate change is also likely to affect hare distribution and abundance, as decreasing snow duration increases camouflage mismatch of winter white hares on brown snowless backgrounds which in turn increases predation-induced mortality (Mills <em>et al</em>. 2013, Zimova <em>et al. </em>2016).",Stable,"The Snowshoe Hare appears in boreal and mixed deciduous forests of North America. It occurs in all provinces of Canada, except Nunavut. In the USA it is present in Alaska, as well as the western mountain states of Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, and Colorado, and small pockets in high elevation areas in New Mexico, Utah, and California. Its distribution also includes the Great Lakes region and eastern states of Pennsylvania, New York, Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and West Virginia. Population contractions have been described for populations in Wisconsin (Sultaire <em>et al</em>. 2016), in Pennsylvania, and the southeast (Diefenbach <em>et al.</em> 2016). Historic populations in the mountains of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, are largely extirpated, with West Virginia now the southern range limit.","5% of the total population is utilized. It is modestly used for food, and to a small extent the fur is used by natives. Historically, it was utilized heavily by trappers for the Hudson Bay Company.",Terrestrial,"In some states in the southern parts of the range, hunting has been closed either temporarily or permanently to try to restore populations. The efficacy of such efforts usually has not been monitored carefully. In some cases hares have been stocked in an attempt to bolster the populations. This method also seems to have limited utility because captive-bred hares are highly vulnerable to predation and transplanted wild hares often succumb to death in captivity during transport.

This species has been introduced  in regions of North America and Europe, and is expanding its range by  displacing other Leporids (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).","The historical habitat of Eastern Cottontails was diverse, including  deserts, swamps, glades, prairies, rain forests, boreal forests,  hardwood forests, and woodlands (Chapman <em>et al. </em>1980). In  developed areas, they survive well in farmland, pasture, and hedgerows  (Chapman and Ceballos 1990).<br/><br/>The diet of Eastern Cottontails is  variable, depending on the type of habitat and the season, including  woody plants in the dormant season and herbaceous plants in the growing  season (Chapman <em>et al. </em>1980). Breeding season varies  depending on elevation and latitude, with breeding activity beginning  later at higher elevations and northern latitudes (Chapman <em>et al. </em>1980). Average gestation time is 28 days and size at birth ranges  from 3.06-5.06 cm (Lorenzo and Cervantes 2005). Litter sizes are 3-5  with 3-4 litters per year (Lorenzo and Cervantes 2005). Total length  ranges from 33.5-48.5 cm (Lorenzo and Cervantes 2005).","Although abundant, subpopulations of Eastern Cottontails are at risk  human perturbation, habitat change, predation from invasive alien  species, and from hunting pressure (sport and local subsistence)  throughout its range. In some locations it is threatened by livestock  competition and habitat fragmentation.","Eastern Cottontails are abundant, widespread, and highly effective  colonizers. New populations of Eastern Cottontails have been  successfully introduced outside their range, and in some cases, they  have been known to displace native Leporids, including the New England  Cottontail (Chapman and Ceballos 1990, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008,  Nielsen and Berkman 2018).

This decline may  be due to the loss of early successional habitat that is being turned  into farmland and is exacerbated by an increase in the cottontail's  predators. In most years, populations of adult cottontails experience  60-80% mortality, but mortality rates in some populations can be as high  as 95% (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).

45198537,9561,Gulo gulo,Least Concern,,2016,2015-05-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The&#160;Wolverine&#160;is listed as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Near Threatened. It occurs at low density and many populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007). There have been large past declines in some of its range but there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al</em>. 2003). Thus although there is an overall continued decline due to human persecution and land-use change, the global decline of this species is not at a rate sufficient to qualify for categorisation&#160;even as&#160;Near Threatened&#160;as of 2015. However, in the mid-2000s&#160;the European Mammal Assessment determined that the European populations&#160;of Wolverine were in&#160;steep decline and would warrant a category of&#160;Vulnerable (A2c). Thus, the Least Concern global listing is driven by the large populations which remain in northern Asia and North America. Wolverine still faces&#160;some threats such as over-exploitation through hunting and trapping, predator-poisoning programmes and habitat resource extraction that caused the contraction of its&#160;historical range. More data on population trends, especially in northern Asia, might result in this species being re-assessed as Near Threatened or even Vulnerable in the near future.","The Wolverine inhabits&#160;a variety of habitats in the alpine, tundra, taiga, and boreal forest zones, including coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain as well as tundra habitats (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al.</em> 1999). Snow is generally regarded as an important component of its seasonal habitat requirements (Banci 1987, Hatler 1989). Wolverine habitat selection is negatively affected by human activity, including roads, infrastructure, and back-country recreation (May <em>et al.</em> 2006; Krebs <em>et al</em>. 2007). It has vast home-ranges (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1998), varying from 100 to 500 kmÂ²&#160;for males and 100 to 200 kmÂ² for females, and good dispersal abilities. Faecal DNA sampling has detected dispersal distances of more than 500 km (Flagstad 2005, Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Hornocker <em>et al</em>. (1983) considered this species to be solitary, with large home ranges and extensive seasonal movements. It is largely nocturnal with some daylight activity&#160;(Whitman 1999).<br/><br/>The Wolverine has&#160;an average life expectancy of 4 to 6 years in the wild, with a maximum of about 13 years (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). It reaches sexual maturity at 2.5 years. It breeds&#160;in early spring to late autumn with litters of 1-5 young (mean litter size: 3) born between February and April (Whitman 1999). <br/><br/>The Wolverine is&#160;thought to have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by other carnivores such as lynx <em>Lynx</em> and Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupu</em>s, as well prey animals felled by disease or injury. It also actively hunts&#160;smaller animals such as rodents, hares <em>Lepus</em>, musk-deer <em>Moschus</em>, roe <em>Capreolus</em>&#160;and wild sheep <em>Ovis</em>. Given the appropriate snow conditions it will also hunt larger animals such as moose <em>Alces</em>. Conflicts arise when Wolverines prey on livestock such as sheep or Reindeer. Given its&#160;dependence on other hunters for much of its scavenged food, the Wolverines is&#160;able to carry and cache large amounts of meat for later consumption.","Within its&#160;current range, extensive human activities continue to pressure Wolverine populations and habitat (Krebs <em>et al.</em> 2004). Overhunting (often by trapping), as well as predator-poisoning programs and resource extraction caused Wolverine populations to contract in the eastern and south-western portions of the&#160;species's&#160;historical range in North America since the early 1900s (Banci 1994).<br/><br/>The Wolverine is potentially locally threatened by its&#160;fragmented distribution and presumed low genetic diversity, as well as by 'population control' hunting and other consequences of perceived&#160;conflicts with people resulting from depredation of livestock. While this species inhabits a zone that is particularly affected by climate change (Rosenzweig <em>et al</em>. 2007), habitat change is not fast enough to be considered a major threat to it in the next three generations. Ample forest and tundra with suitable prey stocks are available throughout much of its range. A low rate of human land-use expansion into this range increases&#160;the frequency of interaction people, notably in conflict over livestock depredation. Given the remoteness of these locations, tolerance of Wolverines taking livestock is low and in some areas 'population control' hunting is used as a proactive means to avoid loss of animals. In Norway, where almost 10,000 sheep are believed to be killed by Wolverines each summer, government committees have instituted annual harvest quotas in an effort to control livestock losses; however, these quotas may not be sustainable as they are set very high even in relation to the most liberal estimate of Wolverine population size, and it is unclear whether this hunt actually reduces the numbers of sheep and semi-domestic deer lost to predators. <br/><br/>Wolverines are scarce in Europe today. Their continued survival is threatened because of their small and fragmented distribution, and the potential for their future survival may be weakened by the likelihood of low genetic diversity. Habitat loss <em>per se</em> is not a substantial threat. Large areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland are still covered by forests and mountains that offer a suitable prey base and habitat for Wolverine. These are not wilderness areas, and the&#160;species&#160;comes&#160;into conflict with a low, but crucial, number of human land uses. There are no large areas within&#160;Wolverine&#160;distribution with no livestock&#160;conflict potential. This results in a difficult situation for wildlife managers who are forced to try and balance Wolverine conservation against the conflicts with livestock. In Norway, farmers no longer use traditional sheep-herding methods that once deterred depredation, so Wolverines are often controlled in an effort to protect livestock. Poaching also occurs. In Russia, over-harvesting and declines in key prey species are threats.<br/><br/>1 and 2. The Scandinavian and&#160;southern Norwegian&#160;populations are subject to illegal killings because of depredation conflicts (sheep, domestic reindeer). The scope of this is difficult to quantify. Furthermore Wolverines are sensitive to human disturbance (settlements, public and private roads, etc.) especially near their dens (May <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;Most people in Norway are settled in southern Norway.<br/><br/>3. In the Swedish forest population/occurrence, high genetic similarity among individuals in the two areas indicates inbreeding, possibly including brother-sister matings (Hedmark 2006). Inbreeding depression and demographic stochasticity are therefore likely to be threats (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). These forest dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of 'domestic' Reindeer, which form the most common prey for Wolverines further north (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997). Establishment in the forest landscape is judged to be a way of reducing Wolverine&#160;conflict with the domestic Reindeer industry (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. In the Finnish â Western Russian population, about half the Finnish population lives&#160;within the Reindeer management area in the north (Kojola 2005), in conflict with this&#160;industry (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b) with associated illegal killings. The scope of this is unknown. The Russian economic depression during the 1990s is believed to have led to widespread poaching of ungulates, and to a reduction of the domestic reindeer herding industry through large calf/breeding losses. This is believed to have indirectly reduced the Wolverineâs&#160;numbers and distribution&#160;in the European and most human-populated part of Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000a, 2000b; Novikov 2005). In Russia the Wolverine is harvested for fur, apparently without harvest restrictions. Russia has not yet ratified the Bern Convention. <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population is small and presumably isolated: it is likely that it will face inbreeding problems (Hedmark 2006) as well as being exposed to demographic stochasticity (Pimm <em>et al</em>. 1988). Inbreeding depression and demographic accidents are therefore main threats, especially because&#160;these forest-dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of semi domesticated reindeer.","Wolverine&#160;distribution and abundance reduced&#160;notably&#160;in the 20th century in the United States of America (Pasitschniak-Arts and LariviÃ¨re 1995), and during the 19th century, species&#160;disappeared from the south of its European distribution mainly through persecution, but also because of deforestation and other human developments. After this&#160;substantial range reduction, there is evidence of resurgence in some places of its historical distribution (Rowland <em>et al.</em> 2003). Throughout its&#160;range, Wolverine occurs&#160;at relatively low densities and requires&#160;large home ranges, typically of 100-600 kmÂ² (Whitman 1999). Densities are never high&#160;(Makridin 1964,&#160;Aubry&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), and it has been found to be less abundant than is Grey Wolf <em>Canis&#160;lupus</em>, even in optimal habitats (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995). Densities range from one per 500 kmÂ² in Scandinavia to one per 65 kmÂ² in Montana, USA (Pasitschniak-Arts and Lariviere 1995).<br/><br/>In North America,&#160;substantial populations occur in northern Canada and Alaska. In the USA outside Alaska, the population in Montana is considered to be the largest and most stable one, given its close proximity to healthy populations in Canada (Cegelski <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many wolverine populations appear to be relatively small and isolated (Ruggiero <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In North America, population density estimates range from one animal per 65 kmÂ²&#160;in Montana (Hornocker and Hash 1981) to one per 200 kmÂ²&#160;in northern British Columbia (Quick 1953), Alaska (Becker and Gardner 1992), and the Northwest Territories (Lee and Niptanatiak 1993). Lofroth and Krebs (2007) estimated densities in British Columbia using existing Wolverine distribution, Wolverine food, ecosystem mapping and human development data. Estimates ranged from 6.2 Wolverines/1,000 kmÂ²&#160;in high-quality habitat to 0.3/1,000 kmÂ²in low-quality habitat. Their total population estimated for British Columbia was 3,530 Wolverines.<br/><br/>The European population was recently&#160;estimated at approximately 2,260 individuals: 1,400 in European Russia (Novikov 2005), 150 in Finland, 326 (Â±45) individuals in Sweden and 269 (Â±32) individuals in Norway (SÃ¦ther <em>et al</em>. 2005). The southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). To the east, the eastern Russian Wolverine population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). The species is not abundant in Mongolia, but still relatively widespread: it is only found in northern taiga habitats in Hentii and HÃ¶vsgÃ¶l mountain ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamsteren 1970), northern parts of Hangai Mountain Range and Mongol Altai Mountain Range (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989). The European distribution is connected to the eastern Russian population along the Urals. The overall European population forms a relatively continuous distribution with five geographically distinct subpopulations. <br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population has shown a low genetic variability and subdivision among populations indicating that the Wolverine in Scandinavia has lost variation through a previous bottleneck and that the current populations are the result of a recent common genetic background (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2001, Flagstad <em>et al.</em> 2004). A recent population estimate is of 580 individuals (at or over one year of age) with approximately 200 in Norway and 380 in Sweden (Larsson 2005, van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2005). The population has a continuous distribution and is narrowly connected to the Finnish â western Russian population along the border of the country of Finnmark in the northernmost parts of this population's&#160;distribution. An initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between these populations (Ã. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). In its southern distribution, the Scandinavian population is a source for the&#160;southern Norwegian population (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2001; Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006) as well as a source for the Swedish forest population(s) close to the Gulf of Bothnia in&#160;southern Sweden (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population was naturally re-established during the late 1970s and was a result of protective legalisation (Landa and Skogland 1995). This population has recently increased in numbers and distribution, but is currently kept at around 100 individuals by various control measurements (Flagstad <em>et al</em>. 2006). Genetic surveys have shown that the&#160;southern Norwegian population is genetically distinct from the Scandinavian population, but the geographic gap between the southern and the main Scandinavian population to the north and east decreased from 100-200 km by the early 1990s to near-connectivity by 2006. Exchange of individuals is limited and the&#160;southern Norwegian population seems to form a sink (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b, Flagstad <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).<br/><br/>3. Swedish forest Wolverine occurrences were naturally established during the mid 1990s (Hedmark 2006). These new occurrences, in two localities,&#160;were probably established by as few as 2 and 2-4 individuals respectively,&#160;and by the mid 2000s&#160;consisted of  2 and 10 individuals, respectively (Hedmark 2006). Non-invasive genetic surveys showed that these occurrences have little, if any, contact with the main Scandinavian wolverine population (Hedmark 2006).<br/><br/>4. The Finnish â western Russian population, in recent decades, increased in&#160;size&#160;and distribution in Finland, but decreased in Russia (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2000a, 2000b). The western Russian population is estimated to be approximately 1,400 individuals (Novikov 2005). To the west this&#160;population is narrowly connected to the Scandinavian population along common borders with Norway and Sweden. Initial genetic analysis indicated a clear genetic distinction between the Scandinavian population and the Wolverines in northern Finland (Ã. Flagststad <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006). It is unclear how the western part of this population (Finland, Kola, Karelia) connects along the narrow isthmus between the White Sea and Lake Onega in Western Russia. This area is judged as an extremely important connection for the northern element of the taiga fauna (LindÃ©n <em>et al</em>. 2000) and these concerns should be further investigated. To the east, the European Russian population has a wide connection to the much larger eastern Russian population adjoining along the Urals in western Siberia. The eastern Russian population is believed to comprise more than 18,000 individuals (Novikov 2005). <br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population was established by translocating&#160;Wolverines from domestic Reindeer <em>Rangier tarandus</em>&#160;herding areas in the north during the 1980s-1990s. It is estimated to comprise&#160;about 10-15 individuals and seems to reproduce naturally (Kojola 2005). The gap between this and the Karelia distribution is about 200-300 km and little is known about exchange between these populations. This population should be judged as isolated from other populations pending further knowledge.",Decreasing,"Wolverine&#160;has a circumpolar distribution, corresponding with the Boreal zone of the northern hemisphere (Kvam <em>et al.</em> 1988). Its&#160;resident&#160;range reaches from Scandinavia across&#160;the Russian Federation (including Siberia),&#160;Mongolia,&#160;and northern&#160;China (provinces of&#160;Heilongiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia)&#160;to Alaska (USA), Canada and the western lower states of the United States of America (Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon and California)&#160;(Whitman 1999).&#160;During the 19th century, Wolverine disappeared from its&#160;southernmost European range mainly through persecution, but also because of&#160;deforestation and other human developments. In Europe the species is now found, mainly&#160;north of 60ÂºN, in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the European part of Russia.&#160;It is a rare vagrant (from Russia)&#160;to&#160;Estonia (T. Maran <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>It has been recorded over the altitudinal range of at least 300-2,400 m a.s.l.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"The Wolverine is recorded from a number of protected areas. However, beca<u>u</u>se of&#160;its high spatial requirement, very few reserves will contain the full home ranges of more than a small number of individuals (Schreiber <em>et al.</em>&#160;1989).<br/><br/>European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year-round in Russia.&#160;In North America, Wolverine management issues include regulating trapper harvest, preventing human disturbance at denning sites, and mitigating for habitat loss and fragmentation (Krebs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).<br/><br/>Key conservation measures that need to be implemented revolve around minimising conflicts resulting from depredation of livestock, reducing legal and illegal hunting of Wolverines, establishing well-planned conservation areas and carrying out surveys to gain a better understanding of the&#160;species's&#160;population and ecology. <br/><br/>Farmers and local communities should be educated in and encouraged to adopt husbandry practices that will minimise depredation of livestock thereby reducing conflicts. Economic incentives could encourage farmers to conserve Wolverines on their land instead of hunting them. A compensation and education programme has been implemented in Sweden with Reindeer herders, where the herders profit financially from identifying dens on their land and protecting them; similar programmes could be applied elsewhere&#160;in the species's&#160;range. <br/><br/>Governments and researchers require a more solid knowledge of Wolverine&#160;population dynamics, prey relationships, habitat-use and distribution, to ensure that legal, government-permitted hunting quotas are appropriate and small, localised, endangered populations are protected. Better enforcement of laws that prohibit Wolverine&#160;hunting is required in applicable parts of the species's&#160;range, with higher penalties to discourage poachers. Governments need also improve coordination between wildlife conservation and agriculture programmes to ensure that conservation areas are established in regions with little risk of conflict with farmers and herders.<br/><br/>The Wolverine has been petitioned twice for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act in the conterminous United States, but the most recent petition was denied citing lack of information on distribution, habitat requirements, and threats (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). In North America, the eastern Wolverine population continues to be Endangered, and the western population remains Special Concern. The&#160;species&#160;is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annex II* and Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. European range states have different monitoring and management regimes varying from strict protection in Finland and Sweden, licensed harvest and control measurements in Norway to legal harvest year round in Russia.<br/><br/>1. The Scandinavian population is covered by both Swedish and Norwegian management regimes, which are quite different. However, both Norwegian and Swedish populations are monitored through annual counting of active natal dens (Landa <em>et al.</em> 1998) and non-invasive faecal DNA surveys (in southern areas). There is cooperation and data exchange between the two national programmes. The Swedish national interim goal is to reach a minimum of 90 annual Wolverine reproductions (requiring approximately 575 individuals over one year of age) (Riksdagen 2000). Sweden has international obligations through the Bern Convention for the conservation of the European wildlife and habitats, the regulation of trade through the European Council Regulation on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora, and the EU Habitats&#160;Directive. The Wolverine is in Sweden is officially listed as 'endangered' and is not subject to hunting. However, recently a few family groups have been killed in the purpose of reducing conflict with the domestic Reindeer herding industry in northern areas. Norway was recently (2003) divided into&#160;six&#160;different management regions with politically appointed management boards (MiljÃ¸verndepartementet 2003). The Norwegian national goal is to control the total population within the limits of 39 yearly active reproductions (21 within the Norwegian part of the Scandinavian Wolverine population) (MiljÃ¸verndepartementet 2003). The total of 39 breedings equals approximately 250 individuals &gt;1 yr of age. Control measurements, killing of family groups in early spring and licensed harvest is used as a management tool to restrict Wolverine distribution and predation on unattended sheep during summer and domestic Reindeer all year around. Wolverines in Norway are covered by the Bern Convention (Bern 1979) and as of 2005 were officially listed as 'vulnerable'. <br/><br/>2. The&#160;southern Norwegian population is&#160;subject to the&#160;same measures and legislation as the Norwegian part of the main&#160;Scandinavian population. <br/><br/>3. The Swedish forest population/occurrence is&#160;totally protected; also see description for the Scandinavian population for further details. <br/><br/>4. The Finnish â western Russian population is&#160;subject to different&#160;management between Finland and Russia. In Finland the species is monitored through a national fauna monitoring programme based on tracks crossing fixed 4x4+4 km triangles. Wolverine has&#160;been fully protected in Finland since 1982. In Russia, Wolverine,&#160;a game/pelt species, is monitored via tracking surveys and numbers are estimated based on daily pats and a calculation coefficient (Novikov 1994, 2005).<br/><br/>5. The Finnish western population, which is&#160;small and introduced, seems to function without the presence of semi-domesticated Reindeer, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, or lynx <em>Lynx</em>. Across the country the&#160;species has been&#160;fully protected since 1982.&#160;A research project comparing nutritional ecology of Wolverines within the three national areas of the&#160;species's&#160;distribution has been initiated. A future aim is to develop non-invasive molecular genetic monitoring of&#160;Finland&#160;Wolverines, similar to that conducted in Scandinavia (Kojola 2005).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is&#160;often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially <em>Microtus</em> and <em>Arvicola</em>&#160;voles (King 1983). Pulliainen (1999) stated that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains. Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King 1983). Specifically in Mongolia, it inhabits&#160;taiga, forest-steppe and rocky parts of the semi-desert. It is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). It is active day and night (King 1983). Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 ha for males, most often falling between 10 and 40 ha (King 1983).","On a range-wide scale, no major threats to the Stoat are known. Locally the species may be threatened by unrestricted trapping and habitat loss through timber harvest or natural disturbance (Fagerstone 1987). In the Iberian Peninsula the species is perhaps&#160;dependent on two vole&#160;<em>Arvicola</em> species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base might be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (R. McDonald pers. comm. 2006). In western and central Europe, the Stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur (ermine) up until at least the 1930s, with c. 30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade (Pulliainen 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.","The Stoat's&#160;total adult population is evidently enormous, given its huge range in both Palaearctic and Nearctic.&#160;The density and structure of its&#160;populations are unstable, because of&#160;short life spans and high reproductive capacity. Populations are greatly influenced by fluctuations in prey supply, especially small mammals (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). Population fluctuations of&#160;Stoat and its prey tend to be more marked at more northerly latitudes (Pulliainen 1999), although fluctuations are also present&#160;in Spain (Blanco 1998, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In much of its range&#160;it is a widespread and common in suitable habitats.&#160;In France, it was declining, but now has stabilised as a result of full protection. In Spain it has been speculated that the population may be declining as a results of declines in the&#160;Southern Water Vole&#160;<em>Arvicola sapidus</em>&#160;(Palomo and Gisbert 2002), but the population trend has not been quantified in Spain or Portugal (Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is abundant in north-western and central Mongolia, but is rare in the eastern plains (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980). However, in some parts of its range it is only recorded very rarely and&#160;seems genuinely to be&#160;scarce, notably the Himalayan&#160;subspecies, <em>M. e. ferghanae</em>&#160;(Kotia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).",Stable,"The Stoat has a&#160;circumboreal range across&#160;North America, Europe and Asia, from Greenland and the Canadian and Siberian Arctic islands south - with much variation - to about 35Â°N (King 1983, Fagerstone 1987). In North America, it is found throughout Alaska and Canada south through most of the northern United States to central California, northern Arizona (Berna 1991), northern New Mexico, Iowa, the Great Lakes region, Pennsylvania, and northern Virginia (Fagerstone 1987). In Europe, it is present as far south as 41Â°N in Portugal (Santos Reis 1983), and is found on most islands with the exception of Iceland, Svalbard, some small North Atlantic islands, and the Mediterranean islands. In mainland Asia, it occurs&#160;south in China to Heilongjiang, Nei Mongol, Jilin, Liaoning and southern Xinjiang provinces&#160;(Wang 2003). It has a restricted distribution in the Himalaya, where it is confined to the west, in Ladakh (India), Pakistan and Afghanistan (Roberts 1977, Habibi 2003, Kotia <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;In Japan, it is present in the central mountains (northern and central Japan Alps) to northern parts&#160;of Honshu (primarily above 1,200 m) and Hokkaido (Abe <em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). Lin and Harada (1998) indicated that they had discovered - but did not name - a new taxon of <em>Mustela</em>&#160;allied to <em>M. erminea</em>&#160;in Taiwan; however, this form is closer to (and probably within) Least Weasel <em>M. nivalis</em>&#160;(Abramov 2006).

They live in a variety of habitats, such as woods, plains, and desert areas, but prefer open or forest-edge zones (Walker 1964). Striped Skunks are most abundant on agricultural lands where there is an ample supply of food and cover (Hamilton and Whitaker 1979). They also adapt to life in urban areas under houses and garages (Rue 1981, Rosatte 1986, LariviÃ¨re <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). They have been known to inhabit poorly drained marsh areas (Mutch 1977). Although recorded up to 4,200 m, skunks usually are found from sea level to 1,800 m (Rue 1981). They are frequently found in suburban areas. Striped skunks are opportunistic omnivorous predatory feeders (Carr 1974). Their diet varies depending on season and geographic location. In most areas, they feed extensively on insects (usually grasshoppers and beetles) associated with grassland areas (as opposed to forests). However, when insects are not available (early spring, late fall), their diet shifts to small mammals, birds, or vegetation (Verts 1967).","<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>&#160;is vulnerable to a variety of mortality agents such as predation, disease, environmental conditions (e.g., severe winter or drought), chemicals, and anthropogenic activities (Rosatte and LariviÃ¨re 2003, Hansen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004,&#160;Gehrt 2005). Another limiting factor on skunk populations is&#160;diseases such as rabies and the resultant control programmes (Sikes 1970). Terrestrial rabies apparently was the case for skunks in Illinois, where population fluctuations are closely tied to rabies outbreaks (Verts 1967). Striped&#160;Skunk pelts were considered valuable commodities in the fur trade in the first half of the 20th century, but their value and the number of skunks harvested for fur declined dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s as fashions shifted away from long-haired furs (Verts 1967). Striped&#160;Skunks may be harvested in most areas of the United States and Canada. In some states, such as Florida, skunks may be taken only in season, but most states allow harvests year-round (Rosatte 1987).","Density estimates for Striped Skunk populations range from 0.7 to 18.5/kmÂ²&#160;but most are 1.8 to 4.8/kmÂ²&#160;(Bennitt and Nagel 1937,&#160;Jones 1939,&#160;Allen and Shapton 1942,&#160;Burt 1946, Verts 1967,&#160;Bailey 1971, Stout and Sonenshine 1974). Density levels reported fluctuated widely between years, possibly in response to outbreaks of diseases (Allen and Shapton 1942, Brown and Yeager 1943, Verts 1967). Skunk populations seemingly have high recruitment and turnover rates because 50 to 71% of Striped Skunks do not attain an age of 1 year (Verts 1967,&#160;Bailey 1971, Casey and Webster 1975). Because of removal of top predators (SoulÃ© <em>et al</em>.&#160;1988, Rogers and Caro 1998,&#160;Crooks and SoulÃ© 1999), altered land use (Oehler and Litvaitis 1996, Donovan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Dijak and Thompson 2000), reduced harvest of skunks (Hamilton and Vangilder 1992), and perhaps other factors, populations of <em>M. mephitis</em>&#160;have increased in many regions during recent years (Andren 1995, Kuehl and Clark 2002).",Stable,"The species occurs throughout most of southern Canada from British Columbia, Hudson Bay, and Nova Scotia, throughout the United States and into northern Mexico (Walker 1964, Godin 1982, Honacki <em>et al.</em>&#160;1982).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Given the ecological and economic importance of this species, there is a need for a better understanding of microhabitat factors that are associated with its&#160;occurrence (Baldwin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Adequate population data are unavailable for much of the range, but the total population size is at least several hundred thousand individuals.","The species is typically associated with late-seral coniferous forests characterised by closed canopies, large trees, and&#160;abundant standing and fallen woody material (Buskirk and Powell 1994, Thompson and Harestad 1994). It dens in hollow trees or logs, in rocky crevices, or in burrows. It is primarily nocturnal. Whilst&#160;partly arboreal, it spends considerable time on the ground. The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals and also includes birds, insects, fruit and carrion (Nowak 2005). Average home-range size throughout North America is 8.1 kmÂ²&#160;for males and 2.3 kmÂ²&#160;for females, and the degree of overlap varies (Powell 1994).","The species still occurs throughout most of its range, but because of loss of habitat, it has been extirpated from many south-eastern areas (Peterson 1966,&#160;Godin 1977). Marten distribution and demographic rates are affected by the loss of closed-canopy forest to logging (Thompson 1991,&#160;Bissonette <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Chapin <em>et al</em>. 1998, Payer and Harrison 2003). Martens are still legally trapped for their fur in most of the western states (Zielinski <em>et al</em>. 2001). By the early twentieth century excessive trapping had severely depleted <em>M. americana</em> in Alaska, Canada and the western conterminous United States.

45224953,3590,Callorhinus ursinus,Vulnerable,A2b,2015,2015-03-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The global population of Northern Fur Seals includes breeding areas extending from the Kuril Islands of Russia, across the Bering Sea, south to the west coast of the United States with the southernmost rookery in the Channel Islands of California. The population has shown inconsistent trends at particular areas with the most dramatic change occurring at the largest breeding rookery, St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska. The Pribilof population has experienced a significant, steep decline in recent years and has failed to recover despite the cessation of commercial harvesting. Although the global population is still in excess of a million animals, the current downward trends in abundance at St. Paul and nearby St. George Island remain unexplained. The Pribilof Islands population represents just under one half of the world-wide population and has declined by approximately 66% over the last three generations (1972â2014). The global change in abundance during that same period was 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Therefore, Northern Fur Seals should remain in the IUCN Red List category of Vulnerable under criterion A2b (due to the fact that the causes of the reduction do not appear to have ceased, are not understood, and may not be reversible based on the unknown cause, and that an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (direct counting and mark-recapture) was used to assess population size).","Northern Fur Seals exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with adult males measuring 30-40% longer and more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. Males can be as large as 2.1 m and 270 kg. Adult females can measure 1.5 m and 50 kg or more. Newborns weigh 5.4-6 kg, and are 60-65 cm long. Pups are blackish at birth, with variable oval areas of buff color on the sides, in the axillary area, and on the chin and sides of the muzzle. After three to four months, pups moult to the colour of adult females and subadults. Northern Fur Seals become sexually mature at three to five years old, at which time females can produce one pup each year for most of the rest of their lives (Scheffer and Wilke 1953,&#160;Scheffer 1962). Kuzin (1999) noted that at times of rapid population growth on Tuleny Island, some females were fertilized as early as age two with five year old females achieving a pregnancy rate of 80%. Gestation lasts 51 weeks, which includes a delay of implantation of 3.5-4.0 months (York and Scheffer 1997). Females may produce pups up to age 23 (Lander 1981). Males do not become physically mature, and large enough to compete for a territory that will be used by females, until they are eight to nine years old. The generation time for females is approximately 12-15 years depending on the determination methods used. Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013) estimated the generation time at 14.1 years.<br/><br/>Breeding on the Pribilof Islands occurs from mid-June through August, with a peak in early July (the median date in southern California is approximately two weeks earlier than at the Pribilofs). This is a highly polygynous species. Males arrive at the rookeries up to one month before females and vocalize, display, and fight to establish and maintain territories.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals usually give birth a day after arrival at the rookery. Mean time from birth to estrous is 5.3 days, followed by a departure for a mean of 8.3 days for the first feeding trip. Females breeding at the Pribilof Islands of Alaska are located relatively far from the foraging areas, which are concentrated at the edge of the continental shelf and hence females in this population consistently make longer foraging trips than most other female otariids, with a mean trip length of 6.9 days. Once foraging begins the mean depth of dives is 68 m and average duration is 2.2 minutes with maximum depth recorded of 207 m and maximum duration of 7.6 minutes. Pups are visited eight to 12 times over the lactation period and attended for a mean of 2.1 days during each visit, before being abruptly weaned at four months old.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals are one of the most pelagic pinnipeds. They spend most of the year at sea, and rarely (if ever) returning to land between one breeding season and the next. Thus, males spend an average of only 45 days ashore a year and females only 35 days a year. Once weaned, juveniles go to sea and do not haul out until they return, usually to the island of their birth, two to three years later. At sea, Northern Fur Seals are most likely to be encountered alone or in pairs, with groups of three or more being uncommon. They forage relatively far from shore, over the edge of the continental shelf and slope. Diving is concentrated around dawn and dusk. Northern Fur Seals spend quite a bit of time rafting at the surface, either asleep or grooming. Many animals, especially juveniles, migrate from the Bering Sea south to California or the waters off Japan, to spend the winter feeding. (Sterling <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The Northern Fur Seal diet varies by site, oceanic domain and season and includes many varieties of epipelagic and vertically-migrating mesopelagic schooling and non-schooling fish and squid. Prey species of importance in the waters off California and Washington include Anchovy, Hake, Saury, Salmon, and several species of Squid and Rockfish. On the Pribilof Islands, prey species reflect foraging patterns on and off the continental shelf. Satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis indicate that those seals foraging on the shelf use typical on-shelf species like Walleye Pollock, Pacific Herring and gadid species while off shelf foragers included species such as myctophids. Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska is a volcanic island surrounded by deep water and the most common prey species there included Northern Smoothtongue and gonatid squid species (Zeppelin and Orr 2010).<br/><br/>Predators include Killer Whales, Sharks and Steller Sea Lions (Gentry 1998).","Northern Fur Seals have one of the longest and most complex histories of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century; exploitation continued through until 1984. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force over time in efforts to manage this species, and they are no longer harvested commercially. Small numbers are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. Harvest levels are declining and are unlikely to be affecting the status of the Fur Seal population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals compete for Walleye Pollock with one of the largest commercial fisheries world. Measurable annual mortality, especially for juveniles and subadults, is caused by entanglements in derelict and discarded fishing gear, marine debris and direct interactions with commercial fisheries. This mortality was highest during the period of active high seas drift net fishing in the North Pacific in the 1980s, but entanglement in debris is an ongoing problem. Long-term ecosystem regime change in the North Pacific and possible changes in the foraging patterns of a key predator (the Killer Whale), may be working synergistically with the fisheries related issues to cause the current population decline.<br/><br/>Like all fur seals, Northern Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. The small colonies at San Miguel Island in the California Channel Islands and on the Farallon Island may be at greatest risk due to proximity to major harbours, shipping lanes and offshore oil extraction facilities.<br/><br/>The effect of global climate change on Northern Fur Seals is uncertain. However, any further negative disruption of their ecosystem should be considered a threat.","The population history for Northern Fur Seals throughout the North Pacific and Bering Seas has been tied to the harvest of seals for their pelts (Kuzin 1999, NMFS 2007). Between the mid 1700s and early 1800s, Russian sealers used Aleut labour to harvest an average of 100,000 Fur Seals, mostly pups, annually in Alaskan waters (Roppel 1984). The commercial harvest of Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands continued with periodic modifications to the sex/age classes of focus until and after the United States purchase of Alaska in 1867. In the late 1800s and early 1900s commercial harvests on land and pelagic sealing continued unregulated until the Fur Seal act of 1911 was signed by Japan, Russia, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States. This treaty prohibited pelagic sealing and reduced the take on land which at its peak in 1868 had harvested 240,000 seals in a single year (Roppel and Davey 1965, NMFS 2007).<br/><br/>In the early 1900s the Pribilof stock continued to grow in abundance despite commercial harvest. Between 40,000 and 126,000 seals were harvested each year during 1943-1968 (NMFS 2007). A new harvest regime was followed in the early 1960s which allowed for annual harvests of approximately 300,000 adult females and 30,000-96,000 subadult males (York and Hartley 1981). The population did not increase as anticipated after this new regime and ultimately commercial harvest of Fur Seals was terminated on St. George Island in 1973 and on St. Paul Island in 1983. Subsistence harvest of subadult males has continued on both islands since that time (NMFS 2007). In 2014, subsistence harvest rules were changed to allow the annual take of up to 150 male pups on St. George Island during a new autumn harvest season. This harvest occurred for the first time in the autumn of 2014.<br/><br/>Contrasting to the Northern Fur Seal abundance trend on the Pribilof Islands is Bogoslof Island, a small volcanic island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Northern Fur Seals were first reported on Bogoslof in 1976 with the first breeding seals noted in 1980 (Lloyd <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1981, Loughlin and Miller 1989). Subsequent surveys revealed an exponential growth rate during the 1990s and early 2000s with the estimated number of pups increasing at a rate of 48.5% annually between the time pups were first observed in 1980 and 2005. This rate then dropped to approximately 10% annually between 2005-2011, the last time the island was surveyed. Such a dramatic growth rate can only be explained by a combination of recruitment and immigration from other sites (Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). Recent studies suggest that the recent slowing in growth rate coupled with increases in foraging trip duration and distance may represent a typical density dependent response to a limited resource (Kuhn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Northern Fur Seal population on Bogoslof has increased to the point that it is the second largest Northern Fur Seal rookery in the United States, surpassing St. George Island. This growth has served to ameliorate the overall decline of the population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seal rookeries in Russia have not been counted since 2006-2009 depending on the site. However, basic trends until that time are documented. Overharvesting in the 19th century eradicated the population on the Kuril Islands where Northern Fur Seals were considered extinct until the mid 1950s. Pup production grew rapidly on the Kurils during 1962-1977 (19.9% annual increase). The population stabilized around 1978 and trend became slightly negative (-0.8%) during 1978-1988. Pup production in the Kuril Islands has increased 82.4% since 1988 (+3.8% annually) and is now comparable to the Tuleny (Robben) Island population. During the last count in 2006, approximately 27,090 pups were counted. Total abundance of Fur Seals in the Kuril Islands currently exceeds 100,000 individuals (Kuzin 1999).<br/><br/>In 1999, A. Kuzin published a detailed description of the biology and history of Northern Fur Seals in Russia with special emphasis on Tuleny Island. He reported that the population at Tuleny at the time of its discovery in 1852 was approximately 120,000. Subsequent unregulated harvest reduced the population to as low as a few thousand animals in the late 1890s. Tuleny Island then underwent a series of population highs and low during various periods of harvest. The maximum population was approximately 180,000 individuals in the late 1960s (Kuzin 1999). The most recent estimate was 140,000 individuals including 42,200 pups in 2009 (Kuzin 2010).<br/><br/>The San Miguel stock of Northern Fur Seals breeds primarily on San Miguel Island, California, at the southern extent of the breeding range. This population has increased or been stable since its discovery in 1968 (Caretta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The trend in pup births includes a steady increase followed by a sharp decline that has been shown to be directly tied to El NiÃ±o events; pup production in 1997-1998 declined 81% due to the redistribution of prey caused by the event. Overwinter satellite telemetry studies have shown that Northern Fur Seals from all of the US breeding sites use similar foraging grounds along the west coast of Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Sterling and Ream 2004). The overlap is not limited to foraging habitat as genetic studies indicate that there is very little differentiation between animals throughout the range (Dickerson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Population estimates for Northern Fur Seals are generally derived by multiplying pup counts by a correction factor of 4.4747 to include all non-pups. A global abundance estimate was generated from the most recently available count and estimate data for all subpopulations in the range using the agTrend model (Johnson and Fritz 2014). The 2014 estimate for localities other than the Pribilofs is a projected number based on the trends at each site. The modelled population estimate used all of the data available since 1966 to project the estimates reported above. The most recent actual count and estimated numbers used in the model are shown below.<br/><br/>Pribilof Islands, 2014<br/><br/>St. Paul Island: 91,737 pups x 4.4747 = 410,496 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>St. George Island: 18,937 pups x 4.474 = 84,737 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Sea Lion Rock: 5,250 pups x 4.4747 = 23,492 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Commander Islands, 2006: 59,805 x 4.4747 = 267,609 (Burkanov and Calkins 2007)<br/><br/>Tuleny Island, 2009: 42,200 x 4.4747 = 188,832 (Kuzin 2010)<br/><br/>Kuril Islands, 2006: 25,164 pups x 4.4747 = 112,601(Burkanov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007)<br/><br/>Bogoslof Island, 2011: 22,905 pups x 4.4747 = 102,493 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012)<br/><br/>San Miguel Island, 2014 (not including Castle Rock): 2,327 x 4.4747 = 10,412 (A.

Berger, Point Blue Conservation Science pers. comm.)<br/><br/>The global population of Northern Fur Seals is estimated to be approximately 1.29 million in 2014, a decline of approximately 658,000 since 1976. Note that this number is different than the sum of abundances given above because most were projected forward to 2014 in the model. Using the agTrend model to project the population reduction at all sites over the past three generations (1972-2014) gives an estimated reduction of 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Annual abundance estimates for the entire range do not exist as there are no consistent monitoring strategies in place. Although abundance is declining, the overall decline is not proportional across all sites. The greatest decreases are occurring in the Pribilof Islands, while populations in the Kuril Islands and Tuleny Island in Russia, and on Bogoslof Island in Alaska have increased.<br/><br/>The decline described above understates the total reduction of the Northern Fur Seal population in historic times. It is estimated that the population numbered up to 2.5 million animals in the 1950s, and it may have been considerably larger than that when there were many more active rookeries before the onset of human exploitation.<br/><br/>To date the only population viability analysis conducted for Northern Fur Seals was described in a report from the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (Olesiuk 2012). This analysis concluded that all subpopulations are presently secure with little risk (0.00%-0.42%) of extirpation within the next century.",Decreasing,"Northern Fur Seals are a widely-distributed pelagic species in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. They range from northern Baja California, Mexico, north and offshore across the North Pacific to northern Honshu, Japan. The southern limit of their distribution at sea is approximately 35Â°N (Rice 1998). Vagrants reach the Yellow Sea in the west and eastern Beaufort Sea to the north. They breed on rookeries in Russia (Kuril Islands, Commander Islands and Tuleny Island (Kuzin 1999), Alaska (Pribilof Islands and Bogoslof Island) and California (San Miguel Island) (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). In the past, the vast majority of the population bred at rookeries on the Pribilof Islands, with substantial numbers on the Commander Islands. However, a significant population decline on the Pribilofs concurrent with the establishment of a new breeding site in the eastern Aleutian Islands and population increases in the Kuril Islands of Russia has resulted in the Pribilof Islands now representing approximately 45% of the global population.","Northern Fur Seals have a long and complex history of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century. Commercial exploitation continued through 1984, and there were many periods of decline and recovery over this long period. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force in efforts to manage harvests. There is currently no commercial harvesting.<br/><br/>Small numbers of Northern Fur Seals are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. For the period 1999-2014, the average annual harvest on St. Paul Island was 463 subadult males/year. Subsistence harvest has declined in recent years such that the harvest has not exceeded 400 since 2005 on St. Paul. On St. George Island an average of 218 males were taken annually between 1985 and 2012 (Angliss and Allen 2009, Allen and Angliss 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Following the termination of the Interim Convention on the Conservation of the North Pacific Fur Seal in 1984, the Northern Fur Seal is now managed on land independently by the Russian Commonwealth of Independent States and the United States.

45225749,8239,Eumetopias jubatus,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-02-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Steller Sea Lion includes two recognized subspecies, the Western Steller Sea Lion and the Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion. Western Steller Sea Lions experienced a dramatic and unexplained population decline of about 70% between the late 1970s and 1990. The population reached its low point in approximately 2000, and through 2015 has shown an overall annual increase of 1.8% per year in the USA. However, in the western Aleutian Islands Sea Lion numbers have continued to decline. Overall, the western subspecies had experienced a population reduction of approximately 50% during the last three generations and continues to meet IUCN criteria for Endangered. The Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion population has increased steadily since 1979, and is projected to be 243% larger in 2015 than in 1985. That subspecies does not meet any of the criteria for IUCN threatened categories.<br/><br/>When the two subspecies are considered together, the large increase displayed by Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion is enough to compensate for much of the decline elsewhere, such that the overall abundance of the species has declined by approximately 13% over the last three generations. This does not meet any of the criteria for IUCN threatened categories. However, because of the slower recovery of Western Steller Sea Lions and a continuing decline in a portion of their range, it is recommended that as a species, Steller Sea Lions should continue to be listed as Near Threatened as they almost qualify for a threatened listing under criterion A2a.","Steller Sea Lions are the largest otariids and the fourth largest pinniped. Both sexes are robust and powerfully built. They are sexually dimorphic, with adult males weighing three times as much as, and growing 20â25% longer than, adult females. Pups are born with a thick blackish-brown lanugo that is molted by about six months of age. The maximum length of adult males is about 3.3 m and average weight is 1,000 kg. The maximum length for adult females is about 2.5 m and average weight is 273 kg. Pups are born at an average size of about 1 m and 18â22 kg (Loughlin 2009).<br/><br/>The age of sexual maturity is 3â6 years for females, and 3â7 years for males (Calkins and Pitcher 1982). Males are not able to defend territories before they are nine years old. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females in the western population declined during the 1970s and 1980s and was estimated to be 55% in the 1980s based on collections at sea (Pitcher <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998). Age-structured modelling based on population counts from the central Gulf of Alaska indicates that the birth rate in 2004 was 36% lower than in the 1970s (Holmes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). Gestation lasts one year, including a delay of implantation of about three months. Females may live to be up to 30 years old and males to about 20 years (Loughlin 2009). Here we use a generation time of 10 years based on life tables derived from collections made in the 1970s and 1980s (Calkins and Pitcher 1982), and other analyses (York 1994, Holmes and York 2003, Van de Kerk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions are highly polygynous and breed in the late spring and summer. Adult males arrive before females and those that are nine years or older establish themselves on territories, which they aggressively defend. Pups are born from May through July, and females stay continuously ashore with their newborns for the first 7â10 days after giving birth. Following this period of attendance, females make foraging excursions for periods of 18â25 hours, followed by time ashore to nurse their pup. Females come into oestrus and mate about two weeks after giving birth. Weaning can occur before the next breeding season, but it is not unusual to see females nursing yearlings or older juveniles (Loughlin 2009). Recent work on vital rates indicates that age specific survival may differ across the range and second year survival is likely dependent on the age at weaning (Hastings <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Fritz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Altukhov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Maniscalco <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions are primarily found from the coast, where they haul out on rocky shores, to the outer continental shelf and slope where they feed. However, they frequent and cross deep oceanic waters in some parts of their range. They sometimes leave haulouts in very large groups but sightings at sea are most often of groups of 1â12 animals. They aggregate in areas of prey abundance, including near fishing vessels where they will feed on netted fish and discarded bycatch. Steller Sea Lions sometimes haul out on sea ice where it is available. They may move long distances but are not considered migratory; juveniles and subadults make the longest trips. Adults usually forage and live near their natal colonies and return to those sites to breed. The area used by adult females for foraging in winter is much greater than the area used in the summer, and females tend to dive deeper in winter than summer. Overall, adults usually forage and use haul-out sites near their natal rookeries, where they typically return to breed. Adult females satellite-tagged in the US portion of the western stock made long pelagic foraging trips during winter, whereas their foraging range was more restricted during summer (Merrick and Loughlin 1997, Fadely and Lander 2012, Fadely <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Adult females are capable of diving to depths of at least 427 m but average approximately 45 m; dives are deeper during winter than summer (NMFS, unpublished data). Dive duration is usually two minutes or less, but can exceed 13 minutes (Rehberg and Burns 2008). Dives of juveniles are generally shallow and short. Diving ability of pups increases with age (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Fadely <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lander <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010), with dives ranging on average from 5-35 m and up to 2 min (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, NMFS, unpublished data). Juvenile Sea Lions satellite-tagged in Southeast Alaska and Washington State made deeper average dives, and had higher dive rates and longer dive durations than juveniles in western Alaska (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Pitcher <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The diving of adult males has not been studied.<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions feed on many types of fishes and invertebrates. Much of the information on diet comes from Alaska, where they feed on Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Atka Mackerel, Herring, Sand Lance, several species of Flatfish, Salmon, and Rockfish, and invertebrates such as Squid and Octopus (Sinclair and Zeppelin 2002). Food habits analysis using samples collected between 1990 and 2009 indicate that Western Steller Sea Lions in the U.S. consumed similar prey by region throughout the time period, but the distribution range of prey use increased over time (Sinclair <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Adult females with young pups feed primarily at night, switching to foraging at any time of day after the breeding season. Steller Sea Lions are known to kill and consume young northern Fur Seals at the Pribilof Islands, as well as Harbor and Ringed Seals.<br/><br/>The primary predators of Steller Sea Lions are Killer Whales (Loughlin 2009). Sleeper Sharks have been suggested as a potential predator of juvenile Western Steller Sea Lions in the Gulf of Alaska (Horning and Mellish 2014), although previous work in the same area found that none of the 198 Sharks examined near rookeries during summer contained Steller Sea Lion remains (Sigler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).","<p>The greatest threat to Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lions has been intentional culling in Southeast Alaska and Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. Those practices were discontinued in the early 1970s and the population has been increasing ever since. Some are killed in net fisheries off the west coast of North America. An unknown number may be shot during commercial fishing operations although it is generally believed that this source of mortality has been reduced greatly since the establishment of federal laws prohibiting killing of Sea Lions in Canada and the USA (NMFS 2013). The 2008 Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan found that there were no apparent threats limiting the recovery of the Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion population (NMFS 2008), and the increasing population trend confirms that conclusion.<br/> <br/> The reasons for the large declines in Western Steller Sea Lion are unclear, but they have been the subject of intensive and ongoing investigations. Deliberate killing by fishermen, disease, incidental take by fisheries, and reduced food supply have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the decline (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1989, Loughlin and York 2000). In the 2008 Recovery Plan, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess their relative impact (NMFS 2008). They recognized three threats as âpotentially highâ: environmental variability, competition with commercial fisheries, and Killer Whale predation. The fact that this subspecies has been increasing since 2000 indicates that at least some of the threats previously affecting the population have been reduced.</p>","The US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) uses a Bayesian approach (agTrend; Johnson and Fritz 2014) to model all Steller Sea Lion survey data in the US range and to estimate the population trends presented here.&#160; Counts in the Alaska portion of the range are made from aircraft using standardized photographic methods.&#160; Counts in the Russian portion of the range are collected from shore or from small boats only.<br/><br/>Counts of Western Steller Sea Lions declined by approximately 69% between 1977 and 2007 (NMFS 2008). Using historical counts (NMFS 2008 and unpublished data; Burkanov and Loughlin 2005, Burkanov unpublished data) and the most recent data from counts made in 2015 (NMFS unpublished data, Burkanov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Burkanov, unpublished data) the decline for 1985-2015 (three generations) is estimated to be approximately 62% in the USA and 50% for the entire population, including Russia. However, despite continued declines in the western Aleutian Islands, overall abundance has increased in both the USA (1.8% per year) and in Russia since the early 1990s (86% total increase between early 1990s to 2013/2015). Total abundance of the Western population is estimated to be approximately 79,929 in 2015 with 55,791 in the USA&#160; and 24,138 in Russia. The Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion population has increased at an average rate of more than 3% per year since 1979. Total abundance of this subspecies in 2015 is estimated from regional data up to 2010, 2013, and 2015 is approximately 80,938 (NMFS unpublished data). When the two subspecies are combined, the global abundance of Steller Sea Lions is estimated to be approximately 160,867 in 2015, which is a reduction of 13% since 1985.<br/><br/>Population viability analyses have been conducted for the Western and Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion subspecies but not for the species as a whole. However, given that abundance of both subspecies is currently increasing the probability of extinction is certainly less than 10% in 100 years.",Increasing,"Steller Sea Lions normally occur from central California north along the west coast of North America, westward through the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula, and from there south along the Kuril Islands to northern Japan and the Sea of Japan (Loughlin 2009). They also occur in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea north to Bering Strait. Vagrants have been recorded in China, and at Herschel Island in the Canadian Beaufort Sea (Rice 1998). The western subspecies primarily occupies the area west of 144Â° W longitude. The eastern subspecies occurs from east of 144Â° W longitude south along the North American coast to central California.","Steller Sea Lions have been harvested for commercial purposes in both the USA (Alaska) and the Soviet Union/Russia, but commercial harvesting ceased decades ago.&#160; They have been used as a subsistence resource by indigenous people for thousands of years. The US Marine Mammal Protection Act allows Alaska Natives to take Steller Sea Lions for subsistence and creation of Native handicrafts, and currently they are primarily taken in communities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Haynes and Mishler 1991). The most recent (2007-2011) estimates of the overall average Alaska Native harvest were 199/year for the Western Steller Sea Lion and 11.3/year for the Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion (Allen and Angliss 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Western Steller Sea Lions are listed as vulnerable in the Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book. Hattori and Yamamura (2014) reported that over 200 Steller Sea Lions were culled annually between 1960-1993 to reduce predation on commercial fish stocks. Recent work indicates that the annual culling was then reduced to a limit of 116/year until 2010 at which time a new 5 year quota of 1,030 culled Sea Lions was imposed. This resulted in an increased annual average take (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2015 approximately 400 Steller Sea Lions were reported to be culled in Japan (Yamamura <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Russia, the major Steller Sea Lion rookeries were given protection under the Northern Fur Seal and Sea Otter Conservation Act in the late 1950s. They were listed as endangered (category 2) in the Russian Red Data Book in 1994 and harvest was prohibited. These measures had a positive effect in the western portion of the range as the population increased around Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and in the northern Sea of Okhotsk. However, abundance along the eastern coast of Kamchatka and in the Commander Islands has not recovered for unknown reasons (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the USA the Steller Sea Lion is listed as depleted under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. The species was listed as threatened under the ESA in 1990, and in 1997 the western population was uplisted to endangered. A recovery plan for Steller Sea Lions was approved in 1992, and a revised recovery plan was published in 2008. Critical habitat was designated under the ESA in 1993. No-entry zones were established around rookeries at the time of listing, and fisheries, particularly those operating in critical habitat, have been managed to reduce the likelihood of competitive interactions. Substantial funding has been made available for Steller Sea Lion research to develop information on ecology, behavior, genetics, population dynamics, and movements. Results have been used to assist in the development of management activities, to attempt to understand the reasons for the decline, and to promote recovery of the species (NMFS 2008). The fact that the overall growth rate of the western population is now positive suggests that at least some of these conservation efforts have had a beneficial effect. A species status review conducted in 2013 found that the Loughlinâs Steller Sea Lion population increased more than 3% per year since the 1970s and therefore it was removed from the ESA threatened species list (NMFS 2013). The western population in the USA is still listed as endangered under the ESA.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45227116,13581,Mirounga angustirostris,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Northern Elephant Seal has recovered from near extinction and population growth is expected to continue over the coming decades. Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the Northern Elephant Seal is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>","Northern Elephant Seals are the second largest species in the order Pinnipedia and they display significant sexual dimorphism in size and secondary sexual characteristics (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1994). Males are three to four times heavier, and nearly 1.5 times the length, of adult females. Adult males reach 4.2 m in length and a maximum weight of 2,500 kg. Mean length for males is 3.85 m and mean weight is 1,844 kg. Maximum weight is seen when the bulls are newly arrived for the breeding season after a summer and fall largely spent feeding (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1990). The mean length of adult females is 2.65 m, and they can reach a length of 2.82 m. Mean mass is 488 kg, with a maximum recorded mass of 710 kg, both values are from shortly after females give birth. Newborn pups are about 1.25 m long and weigh 30-40 kg. Pups are born in a long woolly black lanugo coat that is shed without the epidermis starting at about 4-5 weeks and usually lasting several weeks until after the pup is weaned (Reiter <em>et al</em>. 1981). After molting, the newly weaned juvenileâs coat is made up of short hairs like those found on adults and they are counter shaded dark grey above and silver grey below.<br/><br/>During the time on land for breeding or molting, Elephant Seals undergo a complete fast (no food or water) and their body weight declines dramatically due to the demands of lactation (females) and defending territories (males) in the breeding season, and growth of new hair and skin during the molt (Champagne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult females can lose almost half their mass during lactation, when they take their single pup from birth to weaning in approximately 25 days. The situation is similar for breeding males, which also lose about half their mass while ashore for periods that can exceed three months.<br/><br/>Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years and males at 7-9 years. Gestation lasts 11.3 months, including a delay of implantation. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 95%. Longevity is more than 14 years for males and 21 years for females (Condit <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are highly polygynous, but not strictly territorial. Males compete for access to females by ranking themselves in a hierarchy. There is much male-male fighting, vocalizing, and displaying during the breeding season, when bulls may be ashore for months at a time (LeBeouf 1972). One of the most impressive displays occurs when a male rears up on his hindquarters, thrusts one half to two-thirds of his body upward and produces a distinctive clap threat vocalization as a challenge to other bulls. The sound is a rolling, resonant, metallic-sounding series of backfire-like sounds punctuated with pauses (Sanvito and Galimberti 2003).<br/><br/>Females give birth within a few days of coming ashore, from late December to March. They have a throaty sputtering growl, made with the mouth wide-open, which is used as threat signal. Females and pups have a warbling scream that they use to call to each other, and in the case of the pup, to notify its mother when it is disturbed (LeBeouf 1972). Mother and pup form a strong bond immediately after birth, and females aggressively bite other pups that approach them, occasionally killing them with bites to the head (LeBeouf 1972). However, bulls are a greater source of pup mortality as they regularly crush pups when they charge through aggregations of mothers and pups to chase off or fight encroaching males, or when approaching females for mating. Occasionally, bulls suffocate pups by stopping on top of them and not moving again soon enough (Spraker <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are one of the deepest and longest diving marine mammals. Time-depth recording devices have documented dives deeper than 1,700 m and as long as 109 minutes by adult females. Rest intervals at the surface are usually short, lasting only several minutes between dives that have an average duration of 23 minutes and depth of 520 m (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). After leaving the rookeries, most Elephant Seals spend 80-90% of their time underwater, helping explain why they are infrequently seen at sea.<br/><br/>The diet of Northern Elephant Seals is largely unknown due to difficulties associated with identifying prey for such a wide-ranging species. Observations based on scat and stomach content analysis of animals on land have identified squid and mesopelagic fish as the main items consumed. New evidence from animals sampled at the AÃ±o Nuevo colony (northern California) on diet composition from biochemical techniques indicates that adult females are eating approximately 51% squid, 23% myctophids, and other mesopelagic fish (C. Goetsch pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Great White Sharks and Killer Whales are predators on Northern Elephant Seals (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1981). Recent work at the rookeries has revealed that large Great White Sharks aggregate around these sites when Elephant Seals return to haul out (Klimley <em>et al</em>. 2001). Seals that swim at or near the surface as they are approaching or departing the islands are particularly vulnerable to ambush attacks by fast-rising sharks that patrol near the bottom in waters 7-10 meters deep.","Incidental take of Northern Elephant Seals does occur in a variety of coastal net fisheries, but at low levels. This is assumed to be because they move offshore rapidly after leaving colonies to minimize their risk of predation. Anecdotal information points out to an increase in the number individuals observed entangled on land, perhaps as a consequence of the overlap between their at-sea foraging range and the âNorth Pacific garbage patchâ. Some of the lesions caused by these entanglements could lead to the death of individuals, but there are no data on the rate of animals entangled and their survival. Most of the prey of the Northern Elephant Seal is either of low or no commercial fishery value. If the population continues to expand there will likely be new rookeries on mainland beaches, and there will be additional challenges to keep conflicts with humans and domestic and feral animals to a minimum. The risk of transfer of diseases, such as morbillivirus from domestic animals to Northern Elephant Seals, is unknown, but the species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of disease outbreaks because of their rapidly expanding population and environmental changes associated with global warming (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990). Tourism at several mainland locations in the United States is extremely popular but highly regulated and is not considered a major threat to the species. Tourist access to nearly all of&#160; the islands occupied by Elephant Seals is controlled by law or otherwise regulated in the United States and Mexico, although a number of Mexican islands are inhabited either year round or most of the year by fishermen and their families.<br/><br/>As the species has now recovered from a very small number of survivors, it has likely lost a considerable amount of diversity from passing through this genetic bottleneck, and may now be at greater risk from disease outbreaks and environmental change.","Northern Elephant Seals were a prime target for commercial sealing, and the population was nearly extirpated by hunting during 1818-1869. Due to their pelagic nature, the fact that most animals spend 80% or more of their lives at sea, and that they do all not return to their rookeries at the same time, a few individuals were able to survive the wholesale slaughters at rookery sites. By 1890 only one group of about 100 animals was known to exist (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1990). Following a slow recovery in the early 1900s, Northern Elephant Seals recolonized formerly used sites throughout the 1980s. The total population size in 2010 was estimated to be between 210,000 and 239,000 animals (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). Information for the population in Mexico needs to be updated, but at least for US waters most of the growth in population size has been associated with an increase in the size and number of rookeries in southern Californiaâs Channel Islands. At rookeries in the USA, the population grew at a rate of 17% per year during 1958-1987, slowing to a growth rate of 3.8% per year during 1988-2010 (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Increasing,"Northern Elephant Seals are a wide ranging pelagic species that occurs throughout most of the eastern Pacific Ocean north of the 27Â°N latitude, from the coast of Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, westward to about the International Dateline (180Â° longitude) (Le Boeuf et al. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Breeding takes place on offshore islands and at a few mainland localities from central Baja California, Mexico, to Northern California, USA. The species breeds at over 15 discrete locations, of which a dozen are well-known and occur mostly on islands of southern California and Baja California (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few pups are born in Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia.<br/><br/>Adult Northern Elephant Seals migrate to and from their rookeries twice a year, returning once to breed during December-March and again later in the year (April-August) for several weeks to molt, at different times depending on sex and age (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000). They also show up at additional coastal sites as far north as southern Oregon for molting. Their post-breeding and post-molt migrations take most females north and west to oceanic areas of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska twice a year (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult males, on the other hand, tend to occupy the shelf break along the Aleutian Islands. Few movement data are available for younger age classes and consequently their at-sea distribution is poorly known. Vagrants have been documented in Japan and at the Midway Islands.","The Northern Elephant Seal was heavily exploited for its oil during 1818-1869, after which it was commercially extinct (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960). Few animals remained and in the 1900s they were completely protected by both Mexico and the U.S.",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>In the USA, Northern Elephant Seals are fully protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In Mexico, Elephant Seals are protected from direct harvest under the Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM-059-ECOL-2001).

45229114,17013,Phoca vitulina,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Harbor Seals are distributed very widely and their total population size is estimated at about 600,000. Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies <em>Phoca vitulina mellonae</em>, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Bjorge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Dietz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). <br/><br/>Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).<br/><br/>At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Pierce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). <br/><br/>Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler <em>et al.</em> 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.<br/><br/>Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1989, Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. <br/><br/>Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer <em>et al.</em> 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross <em>et al.</em> 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. <br/><br/>Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie <em>et al.</em> 2015, Skeate <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes <em>et al.</em> 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.<br/>Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknown</li><li>Western Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknown</li><li>Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasing</li><li>Kuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknown</li><li>Ungava Seal--50, trend unknown</li></ul>Combining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized:&#160;the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal,&#160;the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland,&#160;the Ungava Seal&#160;only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays,&#160;the&#160;Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal&#160;is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and&#160;the Kuril Seal&#160;ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","Harbor Seals were commercially harvested in British Columbia, and commercial and recreational use also occurred in Alaska. All commercial harvesting ceased several decades ago. Harbor Seals were protected in Canada in 1970 by the Fisheries Act. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 provided a broad prohibition on taking of any marine mammal. However, Alaska Natives are allowed to harvest Harbor Seals for subsistence and creation of authentic handicrafts, and Native handicrafts and edible portions may be sold in Native villages and towns. Some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Alaska, as well as in Canada and Greenland. In Russia, Kuril Seals are listed in the Red Data Book and there is no legal harvest.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Harbor seals at Svalbard are protected under the Norwegian National Red List. Hunting of Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea was prohibited in 1970 and management of this species in the Baltic Sea and Southern Scandinavian waters is the responsibility of HELCOM. Denmark and Sweden have established Harbor Seal sanctuaries. Neighboring states of the Wadden Sea have signed a trilateral agreement for the management of Harbor Seals. Since 1994, Harbor Seals have been considered vulnerable on the French national Red List. In the United Kingdom, Harbor Seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and the Marine Scotland Act.<br/><br/>In the United States the Harbor Seal is protected from all but Alaska Native subsistence hunting by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also prohibits importation of parts or products from all seals. In Canada, the management of Seals is regulated within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans though the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations of 1993.

Beyond the temporal effects of El NiÃ±o events, no other major threats are apparent. They should be listed by IUCN as of Least Concern.</p>","The California Sea Lion is a sexually dimorphic species; adult males weigh three to four times more and are up to 1.2 times longer than their female counterparts (King 1964). By two weeks of age, male pups are larger and heavier (75.7 cm, 9.01 kg) than their female counterparts (72.3 cm, 7.6 kg; Le Boeuf <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1983). Pups are born with a thick brownish-black lanugo that is generally moulted between the first and second month and is replaced by a darker coat. Nursing may last from one to two years (Newsome <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Male California Sea Lions measure up to 255 cm in length and can weigh up to 523 kg (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Females measure up to 200 cm and weigh an average of 110 kg (Peterson and Bartholomew 1967).<br/><br/>Both sexes usually reach maturity by four to five years of age. Females produce one pup each year, with a gestation period of approximately 11 months. A long-term mark-resighting study (1980-2006) recorded a maximum observed lifespan of 19 years for males and 25 years for females (Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008a). Mean age-specific birth rates for females vary among age classes: for five-year-olds the rate is 0.59, for six- to 10-year-olds it is 0.79 (Melin 2002, Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b), 10- to 12-year-olds exhibit the highest rate (0.80), but the rate gradually decreases for individuals &gt;13 years old to 0.06 in 22 to 25 years olds (Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b).<br/><br/>Pupping and breeding take place from May through July. Pupping starts earlier in the Gulf of California (May 8) than off the coast of California (May 20); the duration of the breeding season is also longer in the Gulf (13 weeks) than off the coast of California (9.5 weeks; Garcia-Aguilar and Aurioles-Gamboa 2003a). Males are highly polygynous and defend their territories both on land and in shallow waters near the shore for periods of up to 45 days. A study on the plasticity of male territorial behaviour in response to varying environmental conditions showed that males inhabiting high-temperature environments (air temperatures &gt;30Â°C, e.g., the Gulf of California) defend territories adjacent to the coast while immersed in the water (Bohorquez-Herrera <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Females remain on shore with their newborn pups for approximately seven days before they depart for the first of many foraging trips that usually last two to three days, followed by another one to two days of caring for their pups at the rookery (Melin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, GarcÃ­a-Aguilar and Aurioles-Gamboa 2003b). &#160;<br/><br/>Following the breeding season, large numbers of adult and subadult males and juveniles migrate north from the major rookeries in southern California and Baja California and winter from central California to Washington (Fry 1939, Odell 1975, Mate 1975). Smaller numbers of animals migrate to British Columbia (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and southeast Alaska, reaching the northern Gulf of Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the eastern Aleutian Islands (Maniscalco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). Other animals remain in the Gulf of California year round and do not undertake long migrations; however, the arrival of numerous adult and subadult males is observed every year at several rookeries and haul-out areas around the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula (Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1983).<br/><br/>During the breeding (warm) season, 96% of the dives by lactating adult females from San Miguel Island, California were to depths of eight to 75 m with 92% of dives lasting less than four minutes. During the non-breeding (cold) season, 77% of the dives were between eight and 75 m and 81% lasted four minutes or less. Most dives during both the breeding (84.5%) and non-breeding (81.2%) seasons occurred less than 150 km from San Miguel Island (Melin and DeLong 2000).<br/><br/>During the breeding season, the average dive depth for lactating adult females in the Gulf of California is 81.7Â±32 m with average dive duration of 3.5Â±0.9 min. During the cold season, dive depth and duration average 48.9Â±18.5 m and 1.7Â±0.6 min, respectively. The distance travelled during the breeding and cold season varies from 72.7Â±21.8 km to 101.2Â±18.5 km, respectively (Villegas-Amtmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Adult females and males exhibit three distinct foraging behaviors to exploit the benthic, epi-pelagic and meso-pelagic environments (Weise <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Villegas-Amtmann<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2011). <br/><br/>California Sea Lions are generally found in waters over the continental shelf and slope zones; they also frequent coastal areas, including bays, harbours and river mouths. Their feeding habits are influenced by coastal ecosystems and they consume a wide variety of prey. However, they usually prefer four to five species at each site, often consuming what is abundant locally or seasonally in the areas they occupy (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Garcia-Rodriguez and Aurioles-Gamboa 2004). Their main prey in California are Pacific Sardines (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>), Northern Anchovies (<em>Engraulis mordax</em>), Pacific Hake (<em>Merlucius productus</em>), Jack Mackerel (<em>Trachurus symmetricus</em>), Pacific Mackerel (<em>Scomber japonicus</em>), various species of the genus <em>Sebastes</em>, Red Octopus (<em>Octopus rubescens</em>) and Market Squid (<em>Loligo opalescens</em>; Antonelis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Lowry 1991, Lowry and Carretta 1999). On the Pacific coast of Baja California, Sea Lions consume many of the same prey species as well as north Pacific Argentine (<em>Argentina sialis</em>) and Jumbo Squid (<em>Dosidicus gigas</em>; Aurioles-Gamboa and Camacho-Rios 2007). In the Gulf of California, the main prey species include those listed above and many other fish and squid species, including Pacific Cutlassfish (<em>Trichiurus lepturus</em>), Plainfin Midshipman (<em>Porichthys notatus</em>), Anchoveta (<em>Cetengraulis mysticetus</em>), Eastern Pacific Flagfin (<em>Aulopus bajacali</em>), Bigeye Bass (<em>Pronotogrammus eos</em>) and Deepwater Serrano (<em>Serranus aequidens</em>; Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984, Garcia-Rodriguez and Aurioles-Gamboa 2004).<br/><br/>Ontogenetic differences in diving capacities and feeding habits have been documented for California Sea Lions (Weise and Costa 2007, Orr <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), which can be affected by El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a events (Lowry and Carretta 1999, Weise and Harvey 2008). During the 1993 El NiÃ±o, adult females travelled farther from the colony, spent more time travelling, made deeper and longer dives, and terminated lactation earlier compared to 1996. Their mean dive depths varied from 19.5 to 279.3 m, but most females made some dives deeper than 400 m (Melin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). During one unusually warm year, adult males that forage almost exclusively over the continental shelf altered their foraging effort by spending more time at sea and venturing up to 450 km offshore (Weise <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>Due to their coastal distribution, abundance and feeding habits, California Sea Lions interact with several fisheries, including those for Pacific Salmon (DeMaster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982,&#160;DeMaster&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1985, Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Weise and Harvey 2005,&#160;Weise and Harvey&#160;2008), causing economic losses for sport and commercial fishermen and a high incidence of Sea Lion entanglement (Stewart and Yochem 1987, Harcourt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Zavala and Mellink 1996, Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>Predators of California Sea Lions include Killer Whales, Sharks, Coyotes and feral Dogs. Before their recent eradication from Californiaâs Channel Islands, Bald Eagles were known to take young pups.","Conflicts with fisheries, poaching and entanglement in marine debris contribute to California Sea Lion mortality (Stewart and Yochem 1987, Howorth 1994, Harcourt <em>et al.</em> 1994, Zavala and Mellink 1996, Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2003). Prey availability is greatly reduced during El NiÃ±o events and large numbers of pups born during these periods die of starvation, as do weaker animals of all age classes (Francis and Heath 1991, Shirasago-German <em>et al.</em> 2015). Sea lion rookeries in the Gulf of California do not appear to be greatly influenced by El NiÃ±o events (Aurioles and Le Boeuf 1991, Szteren <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>California Sea Lions accumulate pollutants through the food chain, and large amounts of DDT and PCBs discharged in the past continue to accumulate in coastal marine food chains that include this species (DeLong <em>et al.</em> 1973, Le Boeuf <em>et al.</em> 2002). California Sea Lions occasionally die of paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by domoic acid, a biotoxin produced by diatom blooms that enters the food web through planktivorous fish, such as Herring and Sardines (Scholin <em>et al.</em> 2000, Silvagni <em>et al.</em> 2005). Diseases also contribute to California Sea Lion mortality, including some contracted from terrestrial animals, like leptospirosis (Vedros <em>et al.</em> 1971), an endemic disease with periodic epidemics of acute disease (Lloyd-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2007). Contact with feral and domestic dogs and other terrestrial animals may expose the species to additional diseases like brucellosis, which may cause miscarriages (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2009, Avalos-Tellez <em>et al.</em> 2014).","Exploitation during the 19th and 20th centuries reduced the California Sea Lion population, but not as much as some other pinniped species (Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Odell (1971) estimated the size of the breeding population on the California Channel Islands to be approximately 35,000 in 1964. Since then the population size has increased considerably.<br/><br/>Five geographic populations have been identified based on mitochondrial DNA: 1) Pacific temperate, from California to northern Baja California; 2) Pacific subtropical, along the west coast of Baja California; 3) southern Gulf of California; 4) central Gulf of California; and 5) northern Gulf of California (Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Using both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, the population structure in Mexico suggests a pattern of isolation by distance resulting in at least three management units: the Pacific coast of Baja California, the southern Gulf of California, and the north-central Gulf of California (GonzÃ¡lez-SuÃ¡rez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). The species does not show signs of a reduction in genetic variability (GonzÃ¡lez-Suarez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009,&#160;Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009,&#160;GonzÃ¡lez-Suarez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).<br/><br/>It is not possible to directly count individuals in order to obtain the total population size because not all age- and sex-classes are on shore at the same time. Therefore, the size of the population is estimated based on the number of births and the proportion of pups in the population following the methods developed by Boveng (1998) and Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1992). Pups are the only age class constantly on land during the reproductive season, and thus they are used as a reference point in estimating the other age classes. The 2007 minimum population on the Channel Islands and at haul-out sites located between Point Conception and Point Reyes was 153,337. For the same year, the estimated total population in the USA was estimated at 296,750 (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In Mexico, the species occupies both sides of the Baja California Peninsula. In 2010, the total population size on the Pacific coast was 58,859 individuals (MilanÃ©s-Salinas 2012) while the population in the Gulf of California consisted of 32,037 individuals (Aurioles-Gamboa, unpublished data). Thus, the total population of California Sea Lions is approximately 387,646.<br/><br/>The California Sea Lion population is thought to be reaching carrying capacity in the USA (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), however recent censuses suggest the population is still increasing (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The Gulf of California does not show a similarly marked fluctuation (Szteren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Ward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010), and animals in the Gulf are genetically isolated from individuals inhabiting the rest of the speciesâ geographic distribution (Maldonado <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995, Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009).",Increasing,"California Sea Lion rookeries are found on islands from Los Islotes in Baja California Sur to the Channel Islands in southern California. Some pups have been reported from AÃ±o Nuevo Island and the Farallon Islands in central California (Keith <em>et al</em>. 1984). In addition to rookeries, this species also occupies haul-out sites, mainly during the fall and winter when predominately adult and sub-adult males move north to Oregon (USA) and British Columbia (Canada; Fry 1939, Mate 1975, Odell 1975). In the southern part of their range, haul-out areas are known to occur on islets off the coast of MazatlÃ¡n and the Islas Tres Marias north of Puerto Vallarta; however, this area has not been surveyed for decades. This speciesâ overall range extends north through the Gulf of Alaska as far as the Aleutian Islands (Maniscalco <em>et al</em>. 2004), and south around the end of the Baja California Peninsula to the Gulf of California. Between 2005 and 2013, several California Sea Lion sightings were reported as far south as Punta San Pedrillo, Costa Rica (Lenin Oviedo pers. comm.). A California Sea Lion male was sighted off the coast of the Yamsky Islands in the Shelikova Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk in 2007, 2008 and 2011. On each occasion, the animal was seen with a group of Steller Sea Lions. It was not observed during 2013 and 2014 (Vladimir Burkanov pers. comm.). Females, which were only very rarely found north of Point Conception, California in the early 1980s, are now routinely found in northern California, where former breeding sites have been reoccupied. However, adult female California Sea Lions tend to reside at their rookeries (HernÃ¡ndez-Camacho <em>et al</em>. 2008a). Based on estimates of sex biases in gene flow, females disperse on average 6.75 times less frequently than their male counterparts (GonzÃ¡lez-Suarez <em>et al</em>. 2009).","<p>California Sea Lions were historically important to indigenous people living in coastal areas and on islands used by Sea Lions for rookeries (Arellano-Peralta and Medrano-Gonzalez 2015). Huge middens in southern California and on the Channel Islands with large numbers of California Sea Lion and other pinniped bones attest to the past importance of marine mammals for subsistence prior to the changes that followed the arrival of Europeans on the west coast of North America (Porcasi <em>et al</em>. 2000, Braje and DeLong 2009). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, California Sea Lions were harvested intensively for a variety of products and hunted for bounties to reduce their impact on fisheries (Cass 1985, Gerber and Hillborn 2001, Arellano-Peralta and Medrano-Gonzalez 2015).</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Protection, which began in the mid-20th century in the United States, was solidified with the passage of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and similar laws in Mexico. These protective measures provided the impetus for recovery of the population. At coastal sites and on most offshore islands, tourism is highly regulated and controlled. The National Marine Fisheries Service regularly monitors the California Sea Lion population in US waters. The Mexican federal governmentâs ComisiÃ³n Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (National Commission of Natural Protected Areas) has conducted annual censuses and monitored the health of the California Sea Lion populations in the Gulf of California since 2011.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Red Foxes are adaptable and opportunistic omnivores and are capable of successfully occupying urban areas. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert (though not extreme deserts) and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant ""edge"" of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the United Kingdom, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red Foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas.","Threats to this species are highly localized and include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. For example, a regional red list assessment in Mongolia (Clark and Munkhbat&#160;2006) classified the species as Near Threatened mainly due to overhunting, while in South Korea, Red Foxes have experienced declines due to habitat loss and poaching and is generally considered extinct (Yu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate).","Red Fox density is highly variable. In the United Kingdom, density varies between one fox/40 kmÂ² in Scotland and 1.17/kmÂ² in Wales, but can be as high as 30 foxes/kmÂ² in some urban areas where food is superabundant (Harris 1977, Macdonald and Newdick 1982, Harris and Rayner 1986). Social group density is one family per kmÂ² in farmland, but may vary between 0.2-5 families/kmÂ² in the suburbs (Macdonald 1981). Fox density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is three foxes/kmÂ² (Meia 1994). Murdoch (2009) recorded 0.17 foxes/kmÂ²&#160;&#160;in the grassland/semi desert steppe of Mongolia.&#160;In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, they occur at densities of 0.1 foxes/kmÂ², and in southern Ontario, Canada at 1 fox/kmÂ² (Voigt 1987). The average social group density in the Swiss mountains is 0.37 families/kmÂ² (Weber <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The pre-breeding British fox population has been estimated at ~240,000 individuals (Harris <em>et al.</em> 1995). Mean number of foxes killed per unit area by gamekeepers has increased steadily since the early 1960s in Britain, but it is not clear to what extent this reflects an increase in fox abundance. Although an increase in fox numbers following successful rabies control by vaccination was widely reported in Europe (e.g., fox bag in Germany has risen from 250,000 in 1982â1983 to 600,000 in 2000â2001), no direct measures of population density have been taken.",Stable,"The Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million kmÂ²) being distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to southern North America, Europe, North Africa, the Asiatic steppes, India, and Japan.

The species was also introduced to Australia in the 1800s, and to Tasmania in the late 1990s (although there is evidence that an eradication campaign for Red Foxes on Tasmania has proved effective; see Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elsewhere introduced to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and to the Isle of Man (UK), although they never properly established on the Isle of Man (Reynolds and Short 2003) and may subsequently have disappeared.","The number of foxes raised for fur (although much reduced since the 1900s) exceeds that of any other species, except possibly American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>) (Obbard 1987).

Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the United Kingdom and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained ""use"" may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport â the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint â hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Present in most temperate-subarctic conservation areas.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success.

46440201,44937492,Bombus occidentalis,Vulnerable,A2be,2015,2014-12-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Historically broadly distributed in western North America,&#160;<em>Bombus occidentalis</em>&#160;has experienced serious declines in relative abundance, persistence, and range in recent years (Hatfield <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cameron <em>et al</em>. 2011a, Thorp 2008). The average decline value of 40.32% over the past decade (based on relative abundance, persistance, and range declines) suggests a Vulnerable Red List Category for this species&#160;(Hatfield&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This finding, along with published reports of bumble bee decline and the assessors' best professional judgement, leads us to recommend this species for the Vulnerable Red List category at this time.<em>&#160;</em>The use of criterion A2b (where population reduction is suspected) can be justified by changes in relative abundance. Criterion A2e may be justified by the potential effects of pathogens or parasites on <em>B. occidentalis </em>populations&#160;(e.g., Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2011a).","<p>Bumble bees are primitively eusocial insects that live in colonies made up of one queen, female workers and, near the end of the season, reproductive members of the colony (new queens, or gynes, and males). New colonies are initiated by solitary queens, generally in the early spring. This process includes locating a suitable nest site; collecting pollen and nectar from flowers; building a wax structure to store nectar; forming a mass of pollen to lay eggs on; and building a wax structure to enclose the eggs and pollen. <em>Bombus occidentalis</em>, like most other species of bumble bees, typically nests underground in abandoned rodent burrows or other cavities (Hobbs 1968, MacFarlane <em>et al. </em>1994, Plath 1922, Thorp <em>et al. </em>1983). Most reports of&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;nests are from underground cavities such as old squirrel or other animal nests and in open west-southwest slopes bordered by trees, although a few nests have been reported from above-ground locations such as in logs among railroad ties (Hobbs 1968, MacFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994, Plath 1922, Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1983). Availability of nests sites for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>may depend on rodent abundance (Evans&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). Nest tunnels have been reported to be up to 2.1 m long for this species and the nests may be lined with grass or bird feathers (MacFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994).</p><p>Once the colony has been initiated by the queen and the first brood of female workers have grown, pupated and emerged as adults, the female workers take over all duties of foraging for pollen and nectar, colony defense and feeding larvae. The queenâs only responsibility at this point is to lay eggs. <em>Bombus occidentalis </em>colonies can contain as many as 1,685 workers and produce up to 360 new queens; this colony size is considered large relative to many other species of bumble bees (MacFarlane <em>et al.</em> 1994). According to Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1983), the flight period for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;queens in California is from early February to late November, peaking in late June and late September. The flight period for workers and males in California is from early April to early November; worker abundance peaks in early August, and male abundance peaks in early September (Thorp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1983). In the late summer or fall, depending on the bumble bee species and elevation, colonies produce reproductive individuals (males and gynes), which leave the colony and mate. Males of this species patrol in circuits in search of mates (Williams<em> et al. </em>2014). As winter approaches, the old queen, workers, and males die, while the gynes continue to forage for nectar, then find a suitable location (hibernacula), usually burrowed a few centimeters underground, in which to spend the winter. Very little is known about the hibernacula, or overwintering sites, utilized by&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>,<em>&#160;</em>although Hobbs (1968) reported&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>hibernacula that were two inches deep in a âsteep west slope of the mound of earth.â The closely related&#160;<em>B. terrestris&#160;</em>reportedly hibernates beneath trees (Hobbs 1968).&#160;The newly mated queens store sperm until they initiate a colony the following spring.</p>Bumble bees, including <em>B. occidentalis</em>, are generalist foragers and have been reported visiting a wide variety of flowering plants.&#160;Bumble bees require plants that bloom and provide adequate nectar and pollen throughout the colonyâs life cycle, which is from early February to late November for&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;(although the actual dates likely vary by elevation). The amount of pollen available to foragers directly affects the number of new queens that a bumble bee colony can produce, and since queens are the only type of bumble bees that can form new colonies, pollen availability directly affects the future bumble bee population size (Burns 2004). Early spring and late fall are often periods with lower floral resources; the presence of flowering plants at these critical times is essential.&#160;<em>Bombus occidentalis </em>has a short tongue, and thus is best suited to forage at open flowers with short corollas. In addition to foraging at the open face of flowers, <em>B. occidentalis</em> is also known to engage in a behavior called ânectar robbingâ in which a hole is chewed in the base of flowers with long corollas to obtain nectar without actually facilitating plant pollination (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014). Rangewide, example food plants of&#160;<em>Bombus occidentalis&#160;</em>include <em>Ceanothus, Centaurea, Chrysothamnus, Cirsium, Geranium, Grindellia, Lupinus, Melilotus, Monardella, Rubus, Solidago, </em>and <em>Trifolium </em>(Williams <em>et al. </em>2014). In Oregon and Washington, the plant genera most commonly associated with&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>observations or collections include:&#160;<em>Trifolium&#160;</em>(20 observations),&#160;<em>Cirsium&#160;</em>(12),&#160;<em>Rubus&#160;</em>(7),&#160;<em>Solidago</em>&#160;(6),&#160;<em>Epilobium&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Spiraea&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Tilia&#160;</em>(5),&#160;<em>Cicuta&#160;</em>(4),&#160;<em>Heracleum&#160;</em>(3), and&#160;<em>Plantago&#160;</em>(3) (database supporting Williams&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). Similarly, in an analysis largely based on records from California, Thorp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1983) reports that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>records are primarily associated with plants in the Leguminosae (=Fabaceae), Compositae (=Asteraceae), Rhamnaceae, and Rosaceae families. Note that these floral associations do not necessarily represent&#160;<em>B. occidentalisâ&#160;</em>preference for these plants over other flowering plants, but rather may represent the abundance of these flowers in the landscape.<br/>The habitat for this species is described as open grassy areas, urban parks and gardens, chaparral and shrub areas, and mountain meadows&#160;&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;This species is host to the cuckoo bee&#160;<em>Bombus suckleyi, </em>based on a confirmed breeding record. It is likely that this species is also a host to <em>B. bohemicus </em>(=<em>ashtoni</em>), <em>B. insularis, </em>and <em>B. flavidus&#160;</em>(=<em>fernaldi</em>)&#160;(Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","<p>Populations of this declining species have been associated with higher levels of the microsporidian <em>Nosema bombi </em>and reduced genetic diversity relative to populations of co-occurring stable species (Cameron <em>et al.</em> 2011a,&#160;Cordes <em>et al.</em> 2012,&#160;Lozier <em>et al.</em> 2011). The major decline of the subgenus <em>Bombus </em>was first documented in <em>B. occidentalis</em>, as<em> Nosema</em> nearly wiped out commercial hives, leading to the cessation of commercial production of this species (Flanders <em>et al. </em>2003). Wild populations crashed simultaneously and the closely related <em>B. franklini </em>has been pushed to the brink of extinction. However, Koch and Strange (2012) found high levels of infestation by <em>Nosema</em> in interior Alaska where this bumble bee was still quite common.</p><p>In addition to disease, this species is faced with numerous other stressors including habitat loss and alteration due to agricultural intensification, urban development, conifer encroachment (resulting from fire suppression), grazing, logging and climate change (reviewed in Jepsen and Foltz Jordan 2013,&#160;Evans <em>et al. </em>2008). Modifications to bumble bee habitat from over grazing by livestock can be particularly harmful to bumble bees by removing floral resources, especially during the mid-summer period when flowers may already be scarce (reviewed in&#160;Hatfield&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). In addition, livestock may trample nesting and overwintering sites, or disrupt rodent populations, which can indirectly harm bumble bees. Indirect effects of logging (such as increased siltation in runoff) and recreation (such as off-road vehicle use) also have the potential to alter meadow ecosystems and disrupt&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>habitat. Additional habitat alterations, such as conifer encroachment resulting from fire suppression (Panzer 2002, Schultz and Crone 1998, Roland and Matter 2007), fire, agricultural intensification (Williams 1986, Carvell&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Diekotter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Kosior&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Goulson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), urban development (Jha and Kremen 2012, Bhattacharya&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003), and climate change (Memmott&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Thomson 2010, Cameron&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011b) may also threaten&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>.&#160;</p><p>Insecticides, which are designed to kill insects directly, and herbicides, which can remove floral resources, both pose serious threats to bumble bees. Of particular concern are neonicotinoids, a class of systemic insecticides whose toxins are extraordinarily persistent, are expressed in the nectar and pollen of plants (and therefore are actively collected by bumble bees), and exert both lethal and sublethal effects on bumble bees (Colla and Packer 2008, Whitehorn&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Gill <em>et al. </em>2012,&#160;Gill and Raine 2014, Laycock <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;reviewed in Hopwood&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). &#160;</p><p>Since <em>B. occidentalis</em> has recently undergone a dramatic decline in range and relative abundance, reduced genetic diversity and other genetic factors make this species especially vulnerable to extinction (reviewed in Zayed 2009), and may lead to increased pathogen susceptibility (Altizer <em>et al. </em>2003, Whitehorn <em>et al.</em> 2009). Recent research indicates that populations of <em>B. occidentalis </em>have lower genetic diversity compared to populations of co-occurring stable species (Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011a, Lozier <em>et al. </em>2011).</p><p>        </p>","<p>Multiple studies indicate that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;has declined, both range-wide and       locally, especially in the southern and western portions of its       range. Ongoing surveys targeting the&#160;IUCN Critically Endangered&#160;<em>Bombus franklini</em>&#160;in       southern Oregon and northern California have revealed alarming       declines not only in&#160;<em>B. franklini&#160;</em>but also in&#160;<em>B.       occidentalis</em>&#160;(Thorp 2008, R.       Thorp pers. comm. 2014<em></em>). Both species comprised 11-12% of       the records at the start of the study in 1998, but, in parallel,       have exhibited precipitous declines&#160;in relative abundance in the years since (Thorp       2008). Specifically,&#160;<em>Bombus&#160;</em><em>franklini&#160;</em>was not found in 2004 or 2005, one       individual was seen in 2006, and the species has not been detected       any year since. <em>Bombus       occidentalis</em>&#160;was not detected during       any surveys 2003 through 2007, and has been seen only in very low       numbers (one to seven per year) each year from 2008 to 2014 (R.       Thorp pers. comm. 2014<em></em>).&#160;</p><p>In a study comparing current and historical distributions of eight bumble bee species in the United States using museum records and nationwide survey data, Cameron&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011a) found&#160;that&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;has undergone a 28% range decline between recent (2007-2009) and historic (1900-1999) time periods. Despite <em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>historically having&#160;among the broadest geographic ranges of any bumble bee species in North America, the 2007-2009 surveys detected the species only throughout the Intermountain West and Rocky Mountains; it was largely absent from the western portion of its range. The relative abundance of this species also significantly declined between the time periods examined, in both of the regions examined (Pacific West and Intermountain West) (Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011a). It has experienced serious declines across most of its range in Oregon and Washington, while still occurring in relatively high abundance in northeastern Oregon (Rao<em> et al. </em>2011). The species also remains common in some of the northern parts of its range, such as Alaska and the Yukon (Koch and Strange 2012, S. Cannings pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p><p>We evaluated this speciesâ spatial distribution range-wide over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). We also assessed changes in the speciesâ relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012). For all three calculations we divided the database into historical (1805-2001, N=128,572) and current (2002-2012, N=74,682) records. This timeframe was chosen to meet the IUCN criteria stipulation that species decline must have been observed over the longer of three generations or 10 years. Average decline for this species was calculated by averaging the change in abundance, persistence, and EOO.&#160;We used these measures of change between the recent and historic time periods to estimate the population trend that has occurred in the past 10 years, and to inform the application of an IUCN category.&#160;This analysis yielded the following results (see also the graph in Supplementary Material of relative abundance and map of change in EOO over time): &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Current range size relative to historic range: 77.96%</li><li>Persistence in current range relative to historic occupancy: 72.56%</li><li>Current relative abundance relative to historic values: 28.51%</li><li>Average decline: 40.32%&#160;</li></ul><p>This analysis indicates that across its entire range, this species has declined over 20% in both range and persistence, with particularly high (&gt;70%) declines in relative abundance over the time period examined. Examination of long-term trends reveals that the species' relative abundance in the current decade is lower than any other decade. In the past decade, this species' relative abundance has declined from 0.035 to 0.018 (<em>c. </em>50%; see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). If this species' long term relative abundance trend continues at the same rate, it will cross the x axis in 60-70 years&#160;(Hatfield&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). These results are consistent with findings from other studies, discussed above (e.g., Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011, Thorp 2008). Overall, the species has declined dramatically in parts of its historic range, sometimes to the point of local extirpation. Where it remains detectable, we infer that it occurs at lower abundances than historically.

Formerly common throughout much of its range, populations from central California to southern British Columbia and west of the Sierra-Cascade Ranges have declined sharply since the late 1990s (Williams <em>et al. </em>2014, Thorp 2008), and there has been significant range losses in these regions, particularly from lower elevation sites in California, western Oregon and western Washington (Thorp 2008, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;</p><p>  </p><p>This species was recently documented from Ontario, based on a record that was confirmed by mitochondrial DNA (BOLD analysis).

Commercial rearing of this species began in 1992, with two origins. Some colonies were produced in rearing facilities in California by a company which imported the technology for rearing bumble bees and applied it to rearing&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;locally in California. This same year, a distributor for a competitor which did not have rearing facilities in North America at the time was granted permits by&#160;the US Department of Agriculture â Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) for a three year window of time (1992-1994) to export queens of&#160;<em>B. occidentalis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>B. impatiens</em>&#160;to European rearing facilities for colony production. Following rearing, these colonies were then shipped back to the U.S. for commercial pollination.&#160;In 1997, commercial producers began experiencing problems with disease (<em>Nosema</em>)&#160;in the production of <em>B. occidentalis</em> (Flanders <em>et al. </em>2003). Eventually, the availability of <em>B. occidentalis</em> became critically low, and western crop producers who had become dependent on pollination provided by this species began requesting that APHIS allow the shipment and use of <em>B. impatiens</em> in western states (Flanders <em>et al. </em>2003).&#160;In 1998, the USDA-APHIS issued permits to allow <em>B. impatiens </em>to be used in the western U.S. However, within a few years, the USDA-APHIS stopped regulating the interstate movement of bumble bees altogether, citing their lack of regulatory authority. <em>Bombus occidentalis </em>is no longer bred and sold commercially and <em>B. impatiens</em> is used widely in the western U.S. (Xerces Society<a> <em>et al.</em> 2010).</a></p>",Terrestrial,"<p></p><p><u>Research Needs:</u> Taxonomic work is in progress to formally distinguish two subspecies of <em>B. occidentalis</em>, the&#160;northern (including Alaska and northern British Columbia) and southern (including the western contiguous United States and southern British Columbia) populations, each of which have distinctive haplotype groups that correspond with morphological differences&#160;(reviewed in Jepsen and Foltz Jordan 2013).&#160;This work to describe two subspecies of <em>B. occidentalis </em>will have important conservation implications, since the northern subspecies, occurring primarily in Alaska and parts of British Columbia, appears to be abundant and stable, whereas the southern subspecies has undergone a dramatic decline. Once the subspecies are described, the southern subspecies will be considered more at risk than it was previously. &#160;</p><p>Since the prevailing theory on the decline and localized extirpation of <em>B. occidentalis</em> suggests pathogen transmission of&#160;<em>Nosema bombi</em>&#160;across wild populations, further work is needed to assess possible genetic differences in the strain of<em>&#160;N. bombi&#160;</em>associated with Alaskan&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;(Koch and Strange 2012), and/or&#160;genetic differences in the Alaskan&#160;<em>B. occidentalis</em>&#160;that may reduce <em>N. bombi </em>susceptibility. &#160;In the Alaskan study, <em>B. occidentalis</em> was arguably the most abundant bumble bee, despite it having the highest prevalence of <em>N. bombi&#160;</em>(Koch and Strange 2012).&#160;</p><p><u>Survey Needs:</u>&#160;Once very common in the western United States and western Canada, <em>B. occidentalis </em>has recently undergone a dramatic decline in abundance and distribution, and is no longer present across much of the historic range.

Extent of occurrence (EOO) and persistence declines have been minimal. We have confidence in the EOO decline in the western portion of this species' range, since there has been significant sampling effort in these areas in the past decade, but more sampling is needed in northeastern and southeastern portions of its range. Much of this species' range is in under-sampled areas, except for a few pockets with high survey effort where this species is generally well-represented.&#160;Overall, based on the above calculations and trends, along with published reports of bumble bee decline and the assessors' best professional judgement,&#160;including field experience of several western bumble bee experts, we recommend this species for the Least Concern Red List category at this time.","<em>Bombus appositus&#160;</em>inhabits open meadows and granitic soil slopes&#160;(Williams <em>et al.</em> 2014). Example food plants of this long-tongued species include&#160;<em>Agastache, Cirsium, Delphinium, Gentiana, Orthocarpus, Oxytropis, Penstemon </em>and&#160;<em>Trifolium</em>.<em> </em>Nests occur underground or slightly more often on the surface. Males congregate outside nest entrances in search of mates. This species is a host to the cuckoo bee <em>Bombus insularis, </em>based on a confirmed breeding record. It may be a possible host for&#160;<em>B</em>.&#160;<em>flavidus </em>and&#160;<em>B. suckleyi, </em>which have been found in its colonies&#160;(Williams <em>et al. </em>2014).<em><br/></em><br/>Bumble bees, as a whole, are eusocial insects that live in colonies composed of a queen, workers, and reproductives (males and new queens). Colonies are annual and only the new, mated queens overwinter. These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length. Bumble bees are well-known to engage in âbuzz pollination,â a very effective foraging technique in which they sonicate the flowers to vibrate the pollen loose from the anthers.","No specific threats have been identified as impacting this species. Generally, bumble bees (<em>Bombus </em>spp.) are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss, pesticide use, pathogens from managed pollinators, competition with non-native bees, and climate change (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, FÃ¼rst <em>et al. </em>2014, Cameron<em> et al. </em>2011, Hatfield<em> et al.</em> 2012). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to the colonial life cycle (i.e., large numbers of bumble bees found locally may represent only one or a few queens) (Goulson 2010, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011, Lozier<em> et al.</em> 2011).","We evaluated this speciesâ spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Historically, native Gulf populations of striped bass have never been abundant. &#160;Due to ecological constraints and anthropogenic alterations, the native Gulf population has recently been restricted to the southern extent of its historical range and is predicted to remain small despite large-scale stocking throughout the Gulf. &#160;The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System (ACF) is the only location where natural reproduction of native Gulf striped bass population has occurred since the 1970s. &#160;There are several merisitic, morphometric, and behavioral differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin populations of striped bass. &#160;Adult individuals of both populations are known to inhabit cool-water, oxygenated thermal refuges when&#160;water temperatures approach or exceed 25Â°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth (thermal refuges) has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months.<br/><br/>The last commercial landings of striped bass in the Gulf of Mexico were recorded in the 1960s; commercial fisheries for striped bass no longer exist in the Gulf. &#160;However, recreational fisheries still prevail throughout the Gulf. &#160;Recreational striped bass fisheries are most popular in Florida and Alabama, but limited in Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. &#160;In addition to fisheries pressure, the Gulf native striped bass population also faces several other threats. &#160;Existing ecological restraints of the area in addition to anthropogenic factors like segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. &#160;Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has also likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protected from predation for young fish.<br/><br/>The restoration of Gulf native striped bass population is a major focus of several state and federal agencies and organizations, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission,&#160;ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee, etc., all of which have collaborated through workshops to develop management plans to maintain this population throughout the Gulf. &#160;In addition to restoring and maintaining the native striped bass population in the Gulf, there are major initiatives to establish and maintain recreational striped bass fisheries and broodfish sources throughout most of the region. &#160;Most restoration plans encourage large-scale stocking of Gulf native and Atlantic-origin striped bass fry and fingerlings. &#160;However, many stocking efforts have failed or only managed to maintain current low numbers of striped bass in the Gulf (populations are not self-sustainable). &#160;Studies have shown that stocking efforts throughout the Gulf will continue to be limited if habitat restoration is not implemented in addition to large scale stocking because reproduction and recruitment of Gulf native striped bass is limited by lack of suitable habitat. &#160;The success of habitat restoration combined with stocking has yet to be determined. &#160;Management plans continue to be revised and studies continue to be conducted to determine the best way to restore the Gulf native striped bass population. &#160;There are also several harvest regulations on the size and amount of striped bass that can be caught in the Gulf of Mexico. &#160;Therefore, the Gulf native population of&#160;<em>Morone saxatilis </em>is listed as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","This is a marine and estuarine coastal species that moves far upstream in channels of medium to large rivers during spawning migrations. In coastal areas, it occurs typically within 6 km of shore. Adults in inshore areas occur over a wide range of substrates. The species has been widely introduced in lakes and impoundments with some populations&#160;landlocked.&#160;Ideal temperatures for&#160;<em>M. saxatilis&#160;</em>range from 18.3 to 21.1 Â°C. Evidence suggests a lower temperature limit of 9.0&#160;Â°C (Nelson <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;In colder months, it tends to seek the warmest water available at depths greater than 1.5 meters.<br/><br/>This species is anadromous, seasonally migratory and has been successfully introduced in many areas.&#160;It&#160;is a voracious predator that feeds primarily on fishes and invertebrates. It is normally gonochoristic, with a rare incidence of hermaphroditic individuals. Males reach maturity at about two years of age and 17 cm total length and females at four to six years and 45-55 cm. The maximum age&#160;has been estimated to about 30 years. Maximum total length is 200 cm (Page and Burr 1991); maximum published weight is 57.0 kg (Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1983).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass use rivers, tidally influenced fresh waters, and estuaries for spawning and nursery areas. This species is a polyandrous broadcast spawner. It spawns once a year, from April to mid-June, or once temperatures warm to about 18 Â°C. Females are estimated to release between 500,000 and 3 million eggs during a single spawning event, but &lt; 1% of embryos survive for more than a couple of months after hatching (Diodati 2007, Sanders 2010).&#160;Juveniles&#160;occupy inshore marine waters and adults ascend rivers to spawn. Preferred spawning areas often are shallow (1-20 feet, 0.3-6.1 meters) and turbid and range from the tidal zone to a few hundred kilometers upstream (usually within 38 miles or 60 km of coast). Spawners often seek areas with strong turbulent flow and substrates of rock and/or fine gravel. Eggs are semibuoyant, drift and sink slowly; in riverine populations, current of about 30 cm/sec reportedly is required to keep eggs afloat and prevent death due to settling on bottom (though this may vary with differences in egg buoyancy in different regions). Juveniles apparently prefer clean sandy bottom but have been found over gravel, rock, and (rarely) soft mud; may or may not move to areas of higher salinity in first summer/fall (varies with locality).<br/><br/>See Hill e<em>t al</em>. (1989) and Crance (1984) for habitat suitability index model and details on various environmental requirements and tolerances (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, toxicants).<br/><br/><strong>Native Gulf Population:<br/></strong>Gulf striped bass populations are most likely riverine and endemic to individual rivers due to lack of documentation of occurrence in open waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and there is very little evidence of interchange between river systems; migratory behavior appears to be reduced in Gulf native striped bass populations (Rulifson and Laney 1999). Additionally, tagging returns for stocked Gulf-strain striped bass indicate that they do not often travel outside the system in which they were released, and they they exhibit limited movement between release site and recapture locations (FrugÃ© <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>A comparison of Atlantic-origin versus Gulf striped bass that were co-stocked into the same habitat over a 5-year period, showed no consistent differences in relative survival or growth through age 4 (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Gulf-native striped bass likely have a higher thermal tolerance than Atlantic-origin striped bass, with an upper thermal maximum around 30Â°C&#160;(Dieterich and Fulford 2012). &#160;&#160;<br/>There are several documented meristic differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin striped bass populations. &#160;It has also been reported that Gulf native striped bass eggs are less buoyant than Atlantic striped bass eggs from the Santee-Cooper system in South Carolina, and St. Johns River in Florida. &#160;In addition, Gulf native larvae tend to be slightly larger at hatching, have earlier yolk sac absorption, and begin feeding sooner than Atlantic-origin larvae. &#160;Hollowell (1980) reported that Gulf native striped bass have darker stripes than the Atlantic population, and that interrupted stripes occur less frequently than in the Atlantic race. Gulf native striped bass <em>may</em> also exhibit faster growth rates, and earlier maturation. &#160;Spawning period for Gulf native striped bass occurs from February to May, with a peak during early April to mid-May. &#160;Crateau (not determined) found that Gulf native striped bass females produce an average of approximately 45,000 eggs/kg body weight and exhibited at least 90% ova maturation in a single spawning season (Fruge<em> et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass adults are known to occupy cool, oxygenated thermal refuges in during the summer, from April through November (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Adults seek thermal refuge when water temperatures approach or exceed 25Â°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;If these refuges are not available during the typical periods of high growth, individuals may not reach sexual maturity.&#160;Dieterich and Fulford (2012) concluded that both of their model predictions combined with limited field observations of fish movement suggest that the period of maximum growth potential for Gulf-strain striped bass is October-April, which may limit young-of-the-year survival during their first summer and may greatly reduce the period of adult growth prior to the spawning season; studies indicate that summer months are the most critical time period for the overall health and long-term survival of striped bass.<br/>Between 1993 and 2009, 94 female and 125 male striped bass broodfish from the ACF were aged. Females ranged from age 2 to 13 and males ranged from age 2 to 7 (Long<em> et al.</em> 2012).<p></p>","<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><em><br/></em><em>Morone saxatilis&#160;</em>populations native to the Gulf of Mexico are limited due to ecological restraints, mainly high temperatures and low DO levels. &#160;These restraints are exacerbated by anthropogenic alterations to their riverine environment, including segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction which blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. The Gulf striped bass populations are also characterized by low levels of natural reproduction. Despite stocking large numbers of fish from Atlantic-origin populations, Gulf native populations are likely to remain small and may decrease due continuing fishing pressure and habitat degradation (Dieterich and Fulford 2012, Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protection from predation for young fish (Rulifson and Laney 1999,&#160;Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006). Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><br/>The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system was modeled under changing climate conditions simulating future climates and future demand for water withdrawal for human consumption. Specific anticipated changes include lower minimum flows and decreased flow variability. These changes could decrease connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent (Gibson <em>et a</em>l. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Introgression<br/></strong>Historically unique microsatelite alleles in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system in Geogia and Florida were reduced in frequency by introgression of non-native alleles due to stocking (Wirgin <em>et al</em>. 2005). Possible results include altered genetic characteristics of the native stock which can cause a change in genetic differences among populations (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 2009), a change in genetic composition (Susnik <em>et al</em>. 2004), and breakdown of genetic adaptations (McGinnity <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>Declines in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (where introduced) is attributed primarily to toxic substances and to entertainment of young in water diversion structures (Hassler 1988). Habitat destruction affected populations in Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Albemarle Sound, resulting in drastic declines in mid-20th century (Hill<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1989). Excess harvest contributed the decline along the U.S. east coast in the late 1970s and early 1980s; hatchery production and restrictions on the harvest resulted in population increases in the Chesapeake Bay region by the early 1990s (Diamond 1990).","<strong>Gulf of Mexico [[<span style="""">[supplementary document: excel sheet]]]</span></strong><p>Although striped bass is an anadromous species, populations at the northern and southern extremes of the range are generally potamodromous, migrating within freshwater systems and thus being riverine or estuarine in nature. &#160;It is likely that striped bass populations within tributaries of the Gulf of Mexico were endemic to individual rivers (Barkuloo 1967, McIlwain 1980). </p>  <p>Within the Gulf, the historical range of <em>M. saxatilis</em> from the Suwannee River (Florida), westward to the rivers of the Lake Pontchartrain basin in Louisiana.

In the 1980s interest in the conservation and restoration of the native Gulf striped bass led to stocking of only putative Gulf striped bass. </p>  <p>The restoration program is supported by genetic studies which show that a high percentage of ACF fish are genetically distinct from Atlantic populations (Wirgin 1990, 1991 1993, 1997), (Wirgin and Maceda 1991). The ACF population is now considered a different âraceâ from those in Atlantic rivers (FrugÃ©&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2006), and any striped bass originating from the ACF system is considered a Gulf striped bass (Long et al. 2012). The ACF population is the only population of Gulf striped bass which supports continued natural reproduction (Wirgin<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

It is marketed fresh or filleted and frozen (Heemstra 2002). Recreational landings&#160;make up about 75-80% of the coastal landings. In 2005, almost 60% of all striped bass sold in the United States were grown in aquaculture.&#160;Aquaculture for hybrid <em>M. saxatilis</em> (<em>Morone chrysops</em> x <em>Morone saxatilis</em>) began in 1986, and production peaked in the early 2000s (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012).&#160;<em> </em><br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no commercial striped bass fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico; the last commercial landings occurred in the 1960s. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries are still popular throughout their range in the Gulf (FrugÃ©&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). &#160;<br/><br/>Creel census surveys were conducted in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama to determine striped bass total catch, harvest effort (hours), and angler success (striped bass catch or harvest per hour). &#160;In the Upper Apalachicola River, an average of 166 striped bass anglers (ranged from 24 to 416) were interviewed between 1982 and 2009. &#160;Directed angling effort was estimated to range from 1,098 (SE = 318) to 9, 485 (SE = 2,936) hours with an average of 3,696 hours. &#160;Annual harvest estimates during early stocking years (1980 to 1992) ranged from 152 (SE = 130) to 1,505 (SE = 474). &#160;Released striped bass were not documented in the survey data prior to 1992; it was assumed that under prevailing harvest regulations, all caught fish were harvested. &#160;Surveys conducted after harvest regulations were changed (1994 to 2009) to reduce the bag implementation and minimum size, estimated that striped bass total catch ranged from 311 (SE = 156) to 1,457 (SE=346) with and average of 688 fish. &#160;Harvest estimates ranged from 134 (SE = 49) to 796 (SE = 214), and averaged 379 fish (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Few anglers targeted or harvested striped bass in the Lower Apalachicola River/Intracoastal Waterway. &#160;Creel survey were conducted in this area during spring 1990-2004 and fall 1990-1999. &#160;The number of anglers interviewed in this area ranged from 250 to 550 and 225 to 502, respectively. &#160;Total catch estimates ranged from 2 (SE = 2) to 1,458 (SE = 990) in the spring, and 11 (SE = 12) to 1,521 (SE = 749) in the fall. &#160;In this area, striped bass were typically caught as bycatch, and most anglers reported releasing their catch because the fish were shorter than the 457-mm-TL minimum size limit. &#160;From the spring surveys, it was estimated that only 1,484 (15%) of the 9,831 striped bass total catch estimate was harvested (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Creel surveys from the striped bass fishery in the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers were conducted from 1995 through 1998. &#160;Within the 26-week period, total number of angler trips at the Albany Dam tailrace (Flint River) ranged from 1,741 to 5,553 with an anverage of 3,855 trips. &#160;Estimated time of direct fishing effort on striped bass averaged 801 hours, and ranged from 442 to 1,056 hours. Expanded harvest estimates ranged from 15 to 37 fish, with an average of 28 fish. &#160;The total number of angler trips taken at the GALD on the Chattahoochee River averaged 6,134 trips, and ranged from 4,758 to 7,437 trips. &#160;Hours directed fishing effort ranged from 0 to 466 hours (1192 hours on average). &#160;Expanded harvest estimates for striped bass ranged from 0 to 70, and averaged 30 fish. &#160;All of these surveys were conducted during open season for the harvest of <em>Morone saxatilis</em> (1 November-31 May). &#160;Harvest regulations for striped bass in the ACF during the time of survey were 15 fish in combination, including striped bass, hybrid striped bass, and white bass, only two of which could be over 559 mm TL (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><br/>Currently, the Jim Woodruff L&amp;D tail race is the primary location for anglers targeting striped bass in Florida. &#160;This recreational fishery has been described as an ""artisanal"" fishery, and angling effort there appears to have remained near the levels (possibly above) estimated at the time restoration efforts began. &#160;From 1980 to 2003, angler effort in this tailrace ranged from 629 hours in 1981 to 9,485 hours in 1991 (Fruge <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational striped bass fisheries in the Tallapoosa, Coosa, Alabama, Tombigbee, and Mobile rivers were discontinued in 1962 when the population declined. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries in reservoirs along the Black Warrior and Tombigbee rivers, Lewis Smith Lake, Lake Martin, Jones Bluff Lake, and some reservoirs along the Coosa River have continued their stocking efforts. &#160;Striped bass are also regularly taken from the Mobile River and bay systems, and the Perdido and Conecuh rivers (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Throughout Mississippi, striped bass has been mostly recorded as bycatch by anglers (not targeted). &#160;It has been indicated that a small amount of anglers target striped bass in the Pascagoula River. &#160;Several records since 1981 reported no recreational landings, however there was a peak in 1986 with 14,154 fish caught (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational fishing for striped bass in Louisiana is very limited. &#160;Fishermen catch striped bass incidentally along the coast, and some charter boats/guides target this species at certain times of the year. &#160;There is a small recreational striped bass fishery in the Lake Pontchartrain. &#160;Reported recreational landings have been noted to fluctuate widely and are probably not accurate (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Based on recent TPWD creel data, no substantial striped bass fishery exists anywhere along the Texas coast. &#160;However, a few anglers in the Galveston and Sabine Lakes target this species. &#160; There is a directed striped bass fishery in Galveston Bay at the outfall in Trinity Bay and is popular during March (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System:</strong><br/>Since the extirpation of the Gulf native&#160;population from most river drainages in the Gulf of Mexico in the mid-1960s, restoration of these populations has been a major focus of fisheries managers in the region. &#160;Atlantic-origin striped bass began to be stocked into many Gulf rivers and reservoirs throughout the 1960s, and continues to the present in some tributaries. &#160;Stocking programs for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were initiated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) for Lake Seminole in 1965, and Lake Blackshear (Flint River, Georgia) in 1967. &#160;The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (currently the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or FFWC) began releasing fingerlings of Atlantic origin into the Apalachicola River in 1976. &#160;Approximately 1.8 million Atlantic fry (&lt;15 mm) and 125,000 fingerlings or adults (25-750 mm TL) were stocked into the ACF from 1965 to 1976. &#160;Hybrid striped bass were also introduced into ACF reservoirs during the 1970s&#160;(Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>Starting in the 1980s, ACF fisheries managers began focusing on the conservation and restoration of the native striped bass population. Genetic description and cataloging was a major component of this effort. &#160;The first annual <em>Morone </em>workshop was in 1982, where biologists and fisheries managers from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) met to discuss management of native and hybrid striped bass in the ACF. &#160;Representatives of conservation agencies in each state and the regional director of the FWS entered into a cooperative agreement of Gulf striped bass restoration for the ACF in 1987. &#160;This agreement emphasized the restoration of a self-sustaining population of Gulf striped bass to the maximum extent possible. &#160;The ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee was also formed under this agreement. &#160;Representatives from Mississippi, Louisiana, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, New York University School of Medicine, Gulf Coast Research Lab (southern Mississippi), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became participants of the workshop series, and as of 2011 the ACF <em>Morone </em>workshop had met for 29 consecutive years (Long<em> et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The first striped bass management plan for the ACF was finalized in 1996 (revised in 2004) with a general goal of enhancing the native Gulf striped bass population within the river system. &#160;Project objectives included:<ul><li>determining hatchery production requirements and optimum stocking rates and sizes</li><li>monitoring broodfish collections and stocking success</li><li>monitoring the sport fishery</li><li>identifying, enhancing, or protecting thermal refuge habitat</li><li>establishing broodfish repositories outside of the ACF</li><li>and participating in public outreach</li></ul>The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's (GSMFC) Anadromous Fish Subcommittee created the ""Striped Bass Fishery Management Plan"" for the Gulf of Mexico (this plan was revised in 2006) (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;The goals of this comprehensive plan were to:<ul><li>establish and maintain a self-sustaining Gulf race population and fishery in the Pearl River (Louisiana and Mississippi), Pascagoula River (Mississippi), Escambia/Conecuh River (Alabama and Florida), Choctawhatchee Riverr (Alabama and Florida), and ACF river system (Alabama, Florida, and Georgia)</li><li>maintain mixed-race fisheries in the Mobile-Alabama-Tombigbee (MAT) river system</li><li>maintain a striped bass recreational fishery in the lower Mississippi River</li><li>maintain Gulf race put-and-grow fisheries in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte rivers (Louisiana), Perdido River (Alabama and Florida), Blackwater and Yellow rivers (Florida), and the Ochlockonee River (Florida and Georgia)</li><li>maintain striped bass put-grow-take fisheries in the Wolf, Jourdan, Biloxi, and Tchoutacabouffa river and Old Fort Bayou (Mississippi)</li></ul>Benefits from stocking large numbers of Atlantic-origin striped bass have not been consistently sustained through time and have not resulted in the ability of the population to self-sustain at a desired level that is significantly larger than previously observed from natural reproduction alone. &#160;Due to ecological restraints and anthropogenic alterations to the riverine environment, feasible opportunities for restoration of Gulf native striped bass populations are limited in a degraded habitat. &#160;In addition, stocking of large numbers of hatchery fish has not prevented the loss of the pure ""Gulf race"" striped bass population. &#160;The physical renovation of several thermal refuges in the Apalachicola and Flint rivers met the objectives (habitat restoration or enhancement) of the ACF plan. &#160;However, due to the dynamic nature of the ACF river system, these renovation efforts were small and short-lived (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fisheries managers from Florida and Alabama have committed to stocking only Gulf striped bass into Gulf of Mexico tributaries within their historic range. &#160;Managers in Mississippi and Louisiana have also expressed a desire to stock only Gulf striped bass, but with the realization that they cannot sacrifice their established striped bass fisheries when Gulf fingerlings are not available for stocking. &#160;Therefore, fish managers in Mississippi are developing a broodfish repository in Ross Barnett Reservoir (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><br/>There is also a current conservation plan in Mississippi to restore naturally-reproducing, Gulf native populations in the Pearl and Pascagoula River systems through a stock enhancement program; the program began in 1967 and remains active today. &#160;However, due to the lack of studies on factors that limit growth and survival of released striped bass in Mississippi waters, seasonal habitat availability in the habitat is relatively unknown. &#160;As in the ACF, probability for population restoration is low in the coastal waters of Mississippi without improvement of the current degraded habitat (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><br/>As of 2002, striped bass had been stocked into at least 68 reservoirs on 11 Texas river systems since the 1960s. &#160;This has been described as one of the largest freshwater striped bass stocking programs in the nation, despite the discontinuation of stocking in some reservoirs. &#160;Most stocking sources were from Atlantic-origin fisheries, but a small number of Gulf native striped bass have also been stocked into Texas waters. &#160;Several successful and popular fisheries have been established in stocked lakes, including Toledo Bend Reservoir (shared with Louisiana). &#160;Natural reproduction by striped bass has been documented in the Brazos River and Trinity River in Texas but these populations are not known to be self-sustaining, and recruitment of naturally spawned striped bass into the adult population has not yet been determined. &#160;Though the river-stocking program in Texas produced successful fisheries, the bay-stocking program did not. &#160;Only 64 striped bass were caught from 1983 to 2003 by fishery-independent sampling. &#160;Most striped bass catches from fisheries were a recorded as bycatch (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><br/>Stocking in Louisiana started in the 1960s when fry were introduced in Toledo Band Reservoir and D'Arbonne Reservoir, and expanded in 1972 to inlcude stocking of several coastal rivers and estuarine areas in tan attempt to establish anadromous/coastal populations. &#160; As relatively small number of Gulf native striped bass has been stocked into two lakes in recent years, but the remainder of stocking in Louisiana was sourced from the Atlantic-origin population. &#160;There was an unsuccessful effort to establish Gulf native brood stock sources in Louisiana. &#160;In the Toledo Bend Reservoir, a put-grow-and-take striped bass fishery has been established, but no significant riverine or coastal fisheries have developed in Louisiana (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:</strong><br/>The ADCNR/WFF striped bass stocking program in Alabama has been very important to the success of the fisheries in many of the reservoirs and tailwater areas of the MAT. &#160;It is likely that a limited striped bass fishery developed in coastal Alabama in 1992, but the fish produced were not preferred by anglers. &#160;The coastal stocking program in Alabama's Mobile River Delta (MRD) was discontinued in 1995, and that fishery has likely declined since that time. &#160;Substantial natural reproduction and recruitment into downstream populations has been documented in the upper Coosa River, which is assumed to mostly involve Atlantic-origin striped bass. &#160;Natural striped bass spawning also occurs in lower portions of the MAT, but it has not been determined if this involves Atlantic or Gulf race fish and whether it has resulted in recruitment. &#160;Natural reproduction alone (without stocking) has not yet been assessed to determine if it can sustain populations/fisheries in the MAT. &#160;Most striped bass populations throughout the MAT are a combination of Atlantic- and Gulf-origin fish except for portions of the Black Warrior River (upstream of Warrior Dam), which may primarily be populated by Gulf native striped bass (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Striped bass stocking began in 1961 when 307-461 mm sub-adults from the Chesapeake Bay were released into Lake Talquin. &#160;In the early 1970s, striped bass were introduced into small lakes and reservoirs of the Florida Peninsula in order to control shad populations and provided a supplemental fishery. &#160;Shad populations were successfully controlled, but fishery establishment failed. &#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass in the Escambia/Conecuh system is uncertain due to lack of data. &#160;Annual stocking in the Blackwater and Yellow rivers is likely maintaining its population. &#160;The striped bass population in the Choctawhatchee River is likely being maintained at a low level by recent stocking efforts. &#160;Since 1996, only Gulf native striped bass fingerlings have been stocked into Lake Talquin in an effort to establish a Gulf native broodstock source. &#160;There is a limited striped bass population and fishery in the Ochlockonee River that is likely supported by stock enhancement. &#160;There is no data available for the striped bass population in the Suwanee River and no substantial amount of striped bass have been stocked into the system; there is doubt whether this system has ever supported a reproducing population of striped bass. &#160; &#160;<br/>The status of the striped bass population in the smaller gulf Coast rivers of Florida is unknown due to lack of data. &#160;However, it was documented that approximately 1,000 Gulf native striped bass fingerlings were stocked adjacent to the St. Mark's River (St. Mark's National Wildlife Refuge impoundments) in 1984. &#160;There are also occasional reported recreational catches from the St. Mark's River (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>Morone saxatilis</em> (Gulf native population)<em>&#160;</em>is likely to be managed by many other government agencies and programs. Harvest restrictions for striped bass have been enacted by each of the Gulf States for coastal waters and rivers (Fruge<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>There are commercial and recreational limits for&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Morone saxatilis</span>&#160;that are managed by state jurisdictions (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 2012, Virginia Marine Resources Commission 2012).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The current global population size is uncertain due to lack of data from major parts of the range, especially from mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, rigorous evaluation against the criteria is not possible. However, plausible projections of the global mature population size indicate that it has probably recovered to over 30% of the level of three generations ago (1940) (i.e., reduction of &lt;70% over the last three generations) but has not necessarily yet reached 50% of that level; therefore, the Red List category is changed from Endangered to Vulnerable. It is important that existing data on abundance and distribution be worked up, and that data be collected in the areas where it is currently lacking, in order to verify to what extent the predicted recovery has occurred.&#160; <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></p>","<p>The available quantitative evidence suggests that the Fin Whale is a generalist feeder, sometimes preying heavily on fish but mostly on crustaceans. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (SigurjÃ³nsson and VÃ­kingsson 1997), while only 1 of 267 Fin Whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada, contained fish (Flinn<em> et al. </em>2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small âaboriginal subsistenceâ catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced âbestâ and âhighâ estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Ãien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East GreenlandâIcelandâFaroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the SpainâPortugalâFranceâBritish Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (VÃ­kingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Brydeâs Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an âinitial levelâ of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the âexploitableâ population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170Â°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170Â°E and 135Â°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (DÃ­az-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50Â°-70Â° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60Â°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60Â°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50Â°-60Â°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30Â°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35Â°E to 145Â°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35Â°E-145Â°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50Â°-60Â°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (ârecruitmentâ) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whaleâs range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39Â°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Ãien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32Â°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40Â°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35Â°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (BÃ©rubÃ© <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (UrbÃ¡n <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40Â°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50Â°-55Â°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60Â°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55Â°-57Â°S 0-5Â°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55Â°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20Â° to 44Â°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (PÃ©rez-Ãlvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23Â° to 29ÂºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (PÃ©rez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29Â°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23Â°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Å iroviÄ <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for âaboriginal subsistenceâ purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS). Under the Agreement for Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, Fin Whales in the Mediterranean, along with other cetaceans, are protected from deliberate killing by signatories to the agreement.</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The only definitely surviving breeding population is in the eastern North Pacific. The North Atlantic breeding population is extinct, and the western North Pacific breeding population is possibly extinct.</p>","Gray Whales are unusual for large whales. They are primarily bottom feeders and are thus restricted to shallow continental shelf waters for feeding. They are largely coastal although they do occur at greater distances from shore on the shallow continental shelf of the Bering and Chukchi seas (Rice and Wolman (1971). Gray whales feed primarily on swarming mysids, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops larvae) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds (Nerini 1984). In one of their main feeding grounds in the Chukchi Sea, Gray Whale densities were highest in areas with high benthic amphipod abundance (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gray Whale feeding may have a dramatic effect on benthic invertebrate communities (Oliver and Slattery 1985). <br/><br/>Gray Whales are often preyed upon by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em> (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2007).","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales have been hunted since prehistoric times, and were particularly vulnerable to whalers due to their slow swimming speeds and coastal distribution. The North Atlantic population was extinct by the early 1700s, although it is unclear whether this was due primarily to hunting (Mead and Mitchell 1984). Gray Whales were hunted in prehistoric times on both sides of the North Pacific, but aboriginal catches declined to relatively low levels by the early 20th century due largely to depletion of the stocks by commercial whaling (Mitchell 1979).</p>  <p></p>  <p>Over-exploitation had been thought to have caused the extinction of the western North Pacific breeding population by the 1970s (Bowen 1974) but its probable continued existence in some form is noted above. The eastern North Pacific breeding population had reached such low numbers by the end of the 19th century that commercial whaling ceased, but it has now recovered to at or near carrying capacity, its abundance showing some fluctuation in response to environmental conditions. </p>  <p>Gray Whales are subject to anthropogenic threats such as entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. Scordino <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated about 10 fatalities per year in the eastern North Pacific and the Bering Sea resulting from known incidents during 2010-15, of which ~80% involved entanglement in fishing gear and ~20% from ship strikes. The threat seems small in relation to the population size of 25,000-30,000 animals, but there are fisheries with little observer coverage, such as the Alaska gillnet fisheries, such that total mortality rates may be higher (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Entanglement rates in the western North Pacific appear to have been comparatively high relative to abundance: out of only 18 records of Gray Whales on the Pacific coast of Japan during 2000-16, there were 10 live sightings, 4 entanglements, and 4 strandings (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). No further entanglements in Japanese waters have been reported since 2008 when Gray Whales in Japan acquired legal protection against deliberate killing and commercial utilization, but it is unclear whether this is coincidental. A Gray Whale death from entanglement was recorded in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/></p>  <p>Salmon trap nets have been set at least since 2013 in Gray Whale  feeding grounds off northeastern Sakhalin, with at least one observed entanglement and at least one probable entanglement death (Lowry <em>et al</em>. submitted). Based on analysis of photographs, approximately 20% of Gray Whales observed off Sakhalin during 1995-2005 showed evidence of scarring from past entanglements (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2009), but it is not known where the scars were acquired. <br/></p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Seven to eight times more gray whales than average washed ashore on the US coast in 1999 and 2000, but the causes of this unusual mortality event have not been conclusively identified (Gulland <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  Perryman <em>et al</em>. (2002) and Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that Gray Whale  calf production is positively correlated with the length of the ice-free season in the main feeding grounds in the preceding season. While this would imply that reduced ice coverage, as predicted by most climate models, could benefit Gray Whales in the short term, the longer term effects of arctic climate change on Gray Whales are unknown. There is some evidence that the distribution on the winter breeding grounds shifts northward in warm (El NiÃ±o) years and southward in cool (La NiÃ±a) years (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This trend seems to have continued in 2015 and 2016, with lower Gray Whale counts in the more southerly Bahia Magdalena Lagoon complex (24-25Â°N) compared to the previous years and with water temperatures 2.0-3.5Â° higher than in 2012-13 (UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2016). The conservation implications in the context of a general trend towards higher water temperatures and more frequent El NiÃ±o conditions are unclear.<p></p>  Plastic debris has been found in stomachs of dead Gray Whales but does not appear to have been a significant factor in the deaths of the individuals concerned.","<p></p><p>Gray Whales in the eastern North Pacific were rapidly depleted by commercial whalers after the wintering concentrations in lagoons along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, were discovered in the mid-19th century. Peak catches, averaging over 480 whales per year, occurred between 1855 and 1865. Lagoon whaling ended by about 1875, apparently due to exhaustion of the lagoon populations, but shore-based whaling in California continued at a lower level until the late 19th century (Henderson 1984, IWC 1993, Reeves and Smith 2010). In the 20th century, there were some pelagic catches off California and Mexico by Norwegian and American vessels in the 1920s and 1930s, and in the 1930s and 1940s by the Soviet pelagic fleet in the Bering and Chukchi seas (Allison 2017). A further 320 Gray Whales were taken under scientific permit in the 1960s (Rice and Wolman 1971), and 138 illegal Soviet catches occurred in the 1960s (Doroshenko 2000). âAboriginal subsistenceâ whaling resumed in the Bering and Chukchi seas off Chukotka in 1948 and has continued into the present, apart from an interruption in the early 1990s. Reported catches during the years 1985-2016 averaged 118 per year. Very small numbers have also been taken by aboriginal whalers in Alaska, and by the Makah tribe in Washington State (IWC 2017). <br/></p>  <p>Despite the continuing catches, the eastern North Pacific population has recovered strongly from past over-exploitation, increasing by 2.5% per year during 1967-96 (Buckland and Breiwick 2002). Abundance seems to have peaked around 1997/98 when a census on the southward migration indicated a population of 24,000-36,000 (Laake <em>et al</em>. 2012). There followed a reduction in population size, with some recovery in recent years. The most recent abundance estimate is 26,960 (95% confidence interval 24,420-29,830) from the 2015/16 southbound migration survey off California (Durban <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2017).&#160; <br/></p>  <p>There was a downturn in population condition around the turn of the millenium involving poor calf production, high stranding rates, and relatively high numbers of emaciated animals (LeBouef <em>et al.</em> 2000, IWC 2003, Rugh <em>et al.</em> 2005). An observed die-off involved at least 651 whales between 1999 and 2001 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Perryman <em>et al.</em> (2002) showed that calf production was related to the proportion of feeding habitat free of sea ice in the preceding summer. Since 2002, calf production has recovered, and mortality and the occurrence of emaciated whales have declined (IWC 2004). The presence of female-calf pairs has also recently increased in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur (Swartz <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population has probably reached a size where it exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment in years when food availability is below average, and is likely to fluctuate around some environmentally determined average level.</p><p>The Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) was estimated at 243 whales (standard error 19) in 2015 and has shown some increase in recent years (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; <br/></p>The combined feeding aggregations off northeastern Sakhalin and southeastern Kamchatka were estimated to number 271-311 whales (excluding calves) in 2016, of which 175-192 were predominantly Sakhalin-feeding whales. The Sakhalin component has been increasing at 2-5% per year. Based on evidence of migration to the eastern North Pacific from tags and photo-identification matches between Sakhalin/Kamchatka and Mexico, it was estimated that at most 100 of the Sakhalin/Kamchatka whales migrate to wintering grounds in the western North Pacific (Cooke 2017). <p>Given documented catches of about 2,000 gray whales in Korean waters  during 1890-1966 (Kato and Kasuya 2002), and the lack of sightings in  Korean waters since 1977, the western breeding population, if it still  exists, is likely at a very small fraction of its original abundance.<br/></p>",Stable,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales are now regularly found only in the North Pacific and adjacent seas. They congregate in winter in or around various lagoons along the west coast of Baja California (Mexico) and small numbers also occur in winter in the Gulf of California and along the Mexican mainland. Some calves are born during the southward migration and the remainder are born in shallow bays and lagoons on the west coast of Baja California (Jones and Swartz 2002). In spring, the population migrates to feeding grounds mainly in the shallow waters of the northwestern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi and Beaufort seas, with some individuals migrating as far westward as Kamchatka and Sakhalin, Russia (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Gray Whales also summer and feed along the Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Kodiak Island, Alaska; those animals are known as the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p></p>Former whaling grounds off Korea and southwestern Japan indicate the existence of a separate western North Pacific or Asian population that migrated to breeding grounds south of the Korean Peninsula, based on the seasonality of catches in the Korean grounds (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kato and Kasuya 2002). The last sighting in Korean waters was in 1977, and recent surveys in Korean waters have failed to find any Gray Whales (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Gray Whales, including mothers with calves, return every year to a feeding ground off northeastern Sakhalin (Weller <em>et al</em>.  1999). This group was until recently thought to be a remnant of the  western breeding stock that was exploited in the Korean whaling grounds;  the Russian name âKorean-Okhotsk gray whaleâ for this population was  based on this assumption. Tracking with satellite-linked tags and  photo-matching data (Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weller <em>et al</em>.  2012) show that at least some of the Sakhalin whales migrate to the  eastern North Pacific in winter. However, the number of movements  recorded to date has not been sufficient to conclude that all Gray  Whales observed off Sakhalin belong to the eastern breeding population  (Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2017, IWC 2017).  <br/>  <p>Since 1990, about 30 sightings and strandings have been documented in Japan, mainly on the Pacific coast (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). These include at least one reproductive female moving between Sakhalin and Japan and one individual seen in successive years alternately off Sakhalin in summer and off Japan in winter and spring (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nakamura <em>et al</em>. 2017). There have also been a few strandings on the coast of mainland China from the northern Yellow Sea to the Hainan Strait in the south (Zhu and Yue 1998), and one animal caught in fishing gear in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, at least some of the Gray Whales that feed in the Okhotsk Sea migrate into Japanese waters and possibly farther south in winter;&#160;these may be a remnant of the historical Asian Gray Whale population, but it is not known whether there exists an Asian calving and nursery aggregation, as occurs in Baja California. <br/> <br/> Gray Whales were once present in the North Atlantic as well as the North Pacific. Sub-fossil remains, the most recent dated to around 1675, have been found on the eastern seaboard of North America from Florida to New Jersey and on the coasts of the English Channel and the North and Baltic seas (Mead and Mitchell 1984). There are historical accounts of living Gray Whales from Iceland in the early 1600s and possibly off New England in the early 1700s (Rice 1998). </p>  A few rare occurrences of Gray Whales outside their normal range have recently been documented. One was seen in May 2010 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel, and a few days later again off Spain (Scheinin <em>et al.</em> 2011). A Gray Whale was found stranded on the coast of El Salvador in July 2010, the southernmost record known in the Pacific Ocean (previously, the southernmost record was in BahÃ­a de Banderas, Mexico) (Barraza 2011). A Gray Whale was seen in May 2013 off Namibia, possibly a juvenile and the only report to date of a Gray Whale in the Southern Hemisphere (Elwen and Gridley 2013).","<p>Commercial whaling of Gray Whales has ceased, but aboriginal subsistence whaling continues, primarily off Chukotka with a few taken in some years in Alaska. The IWC permitted a catch of 744 Gray Whales during the years 2013-18 with a maximum of 140 in any one year.</p>",Marine,"<p>Gray Whales have been protected from commercial whaling by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor convention since 1936. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC, and catch limits have been set since the 1970s on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (most recently under its new aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure) and requests from the relevant governments (Russian Federation and U.S.A.). The current (2013-2018) catch limit for the eastern subpopulation is 744 for the six years, subject to a maximum of 140 in any single year (IWC 2017). </p>  Three Gray Whale breeding lagoons in Mexico (Laguna Ojo de Liebre, Laguna San Ignacio, and Laguna Guerrero Negro) enjoy some protection in the form of limitations on boating, fishing, and coastal development, originally as National Gray Whale Refuges, now through their inclusions in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which is also listed internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar protected wetland (Hoyt 2005).<br/> <br/> The Gray Whale has a measure of legal protection in Russian waters through inclusion in the Russian Federation Red Book of Threatened Species: the Korean-Okhotsk subpopulation is listed as Endangered while the eastern North Pacific population, which migrates in Russian waters in summer, is listed as âRecovery and Restorationâ. The Gray Whale has been legally protected in Japan since 2008: deliberate killing and commercial utilization are prohibited.

50355227,9249,Globicephala macrorhynchus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-06-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale is a highly social species with a wide distribution in tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It is relatively common and abundant in some areas. The difficulty of distinguishing this species from the Long-finned Pilot Whale (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) at sea in areas where the two speciesâ ranges overlap compounds the problem of obtaining reliable estimates for such areas. The total of all available abundance estimates for Short-finned Pilot Whales is approximately 700,000 but large parts of the species range have not been surveyed and therefore actual abundance must be considerably greater than this. Information on trends in abundance at the global scale is lacking but a lack of threats over much of the range does not suggest declining trends.<br/><br/>The Short-finned Pilot Whale was listed&#160;on the IUCN Red List&#160;as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and in large parts of the tropical and warm temperate North Atlantic Ocean. However, these whales are widely distributed in warm waters of all oceans, they appear to be relatively abundant in many parts of their range, and no threats are considered significant or pervasive throughout the range of the species. There is no indication of large-scale mortality (other than by mass stranding, which is characteristic of both species of <em>Globicephala</em>) or population declines at present, and therefore the species is listed as Least Concern. The species has been hunted in Japan for many centuries and this continued exploitation may well have caused a significant decline in at least the near-shore waters of Japan.</p>","<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are typically found in deep waters over the outer continental shelf or continental slope and are generally nomadic although resident or at least semi-resident populations have been documented in Hawaii (Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2017), the Madeira Islands, and coastal California (Olson 2018). They occur in tropical to cool temperate waters, warmer than those preferred by Long-finned Pilot Whales which off the east coast of the United States were primarily found in sea surface temperatures &lt;22Â°C and were uncommon in temperatures &gt;25Â°C (Garrison and Rosel 2017).<br/><br/>In 1982â83, a strong El NiÃ±o event brought about major ecosystem changes off the southern California coast, an event linked with the virtual disappearance of Short-finned Pilot Whales from the area for a number of years (Barlow 2006). The speciesâ current distribution in the area is thought to be linked to seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature and productivity (Forney and Barlow 1998, Barlow and Forney 2007, Pardo<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Off the coast of Japan, the southern form of Short-finned Pilot Whale occurs within the warm Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Counter Current, while the range of the northern form is limited to a smaller area within the cold, nutrient-rich Oyashio Current (Kasuya 2017). Pilot whales are primarily adapted to feeding on squid, with reduced tooth counts associated with suction feeding (Werth 2000), and some populations demonstrate deep, fast dives in pursuit of large, high calorie squid species (Aguilar Soto<em> et al.</em> 2008, Olson 2018). On the east coast of the United States, stranded Short-finned Pilot Whales were recorded to feed on a wide range of prey items, including the oceanic Common Arm Squid (<em>Brachioteuthis riisei</em>) as well as other predominantly oceanic squid and fish species (Mintzer<em> et al.</em> 2008). In contrast neritic squid of the genus <em>Loligo</em>&#160;were more commonly found in the stomachs of Short-finned Pilot Whales on the west coast of the United States (Sinclair 1992).</p>","<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale has been exploited for centuries in the western North Pacific. The largest catches have recently occurred off Japan, where a few hundred are taken annually by hand- or crossbow-projected harpooning, driving, and small-type whaling (defined as the use of a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size) (Kasuya 2018). Catches from all cetacean hunts in Japan have been compiled since 1972 and the southern form comprises the vast majority of all Pilot Whale catches, which from 1972 to 2009 have annually ranged from 100 to about 500 (Kasuya 2017). From 1993-2004, the annual quota for all Short-finned Pilot Whale takes in Japan was 500, a large proportion of which was allocated to the drive hunt in Taiji. Since 1972, the largest reported catch in Taiji was 605 in 1980, and after that time catches in Taiji have ranged from tens of animals to several hundred, and the number taken has in general declined. The decline was assumed to be due to the low availability of animals (Kasuya 2017). The coastal population of southern-form whales is at least locally depleted and the coastal populations of both forms are listed as Rare (equivalent to Red List category Near Threatened) in the Japanese Red Data Book (Ohdachi <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales (called Blackfish locally) were regularly hunted for food as recently as the 1980s at several Caribbean islands (e.g., St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique), although recent and past documentation has been sporadic and often incomplete (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975, Price 1985, Reeves 1988). The hunt has continued at least in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where since 1962 the local hunters took an average of 141 Pilot Whales and 159 dolphins of various species annually through 2009 (Fielding 2013).<br/><br/>Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) reported on directed hunting of marine mammals in central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao, and Palawan, Philippines. Hunters at four of the seven investigated fishing villages took cetaceans, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, for bait or human consumption. However, interview surveys conducted in these villages in 2012 indicated that the practice had ceased by that time, in part due to fear of legal prosecutions after the passing of Fisheries Administrative Order 185 banning direct cetacean takes in 1992 (L. Dolar pers. comm. 2018). Large deliberate catches of Short-finned Pilot Whales (&gt;500 in 1996-97) in âtiger netsâ in Indonesia were reported in the early 2000s (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005) but it was not clear whether this exploitation (for pet food) was continuing. The villages of Lamalera and Lamakera on two remote islands in the Savu Sea in Indonesia have conducted regular hunts for Sperm Whales (<em>Physeter macrocephalus</em>) and other species, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, since the 1600s, and the practice continues today, although numbers of Pilot Whales taken are not available (Mustika 2006, Emont 2017).<br/><br/>It is likely that Short-finned Pilot Whales are killed in moderate numbers in longline and drift gillnet fisheries throughout their range, but there is very little documentation from most range states. This species was noted to be the major depredator of longlines around Fiji (Donoghue<em> et al.</em> 2003). Short-finned Pilot Whales were one of the species documented as occasionally interacting with tuna fisheries in the western tropical Indian Ocean (Romanov 2002. Escalle<em> et al.</em> 2015). Around the island of Mayotte (northeastern Mozambique Channel), there is evidence of interaction between Short-finned Pilot Whales and long-line fisheries, inferred from non-lethal injuries on dorsal fins and information from fishermen (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2008). An unknown number are taken incidentally by large-mesh driftnets in Taiwan (Perrin<em> et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are known to be incidentally taken in a deep-set longline fishery that targets primarily tunas in Hawaiian waters (Bradford and Forney 2014, Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2014) and also in a drift gillnet fishery off California (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). Bycatch of Short-finned Pilot Whales is more significant on the east coast of the United States where the estimated mean annual total estimated fisheries-related serious injury and mortality in the period of 2010-2014 was estimated at 233 (CV 0.24) and is cause for concern under provisions of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017). The most common human-related cause of death observed in waters off Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands was âentanglement and accidental capturesâ, followed by gunshots and spear wounds (Mignucci-Giannoni<em> et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales and other deep diving species, Short-finned Pilot Whales are likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by naval sonar and seismic surveys (Cox<em> et al.</em> 2006, Weir 2008). While conclusive evidence of cause and effect are often lacking, some Short-finned Pilot Whale mass stranding events have been spatially and temporally associated with high levels of anthropogenic sound (Hohn<em> et al.</em> 2006, Parsons 2017). Around Taiwan and adjacent areas, a series of unusual strandings of Short-finned Pilot Whales coincided with large-scale military exercises in 2004, but whether these strandings were related to the exercises is unknown (Wang and Yang 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Moderate levels of various contaminants have been found in the blubber of Short-finned Pilot Whales, including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides (DDT, DDE, dieldrin, etc.) (Gaskin<em> et al.</em> 1974, Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002). In Japan and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, levels of mercury, PCBs, dieldrin, and other contaminants in the blubber and meat from Pilot Whales and other species killed for food were considered above recommended levels for human consumption (Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002, Fielding and Evans 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Estimates of abundance for Short-finned Pilot Whales exist for several areas. Line transect surveys in Japanese waters generated an abundance estimate of 53,609 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.22) for the southern form (Miyashita 1993) and an estimate of 4,321 (CV 0.61) for the northern form (IWC 1992). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance for two areas in the Philippines: the eastern Sulu Sea, 7,492 (CV 0.29) and the TaÃ±on Strait, 179 (CV 0.96). A line transect survey in the Eastern Tropical Pacific in 2000 generated an estimate of 589,000 (CV 0.26) Short-finned Pilot Whales, with a steadily increasing trend during the eight surveys that were conducted between 1986 and 2000, although immigration and emigration and slightly changing survey areas may also have influenced numbers from one year to the next (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone&#160;(EEZ)&#160;in 2010 yielded an abundance estimate of 19,503 (CV 0.49) (Bradford<em> et al.</em> 2017). Trend data for Pilot Whales in this region are not available due to broad and overlapping confidence intervals between this and previous estimates (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). The best recent estimate for Short-finned Pilot Whales off the west coast of the USA is 836 (CV 0.79), based on the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys of California, Oregon, and Washington waters (Barlow 2016). The species was more abundant in this area prior to a strong El NiÃ±o event that resulted in apparent ecosystem changes in 1982-83, and it is unknown whether the animals present in smaller numbers now are part of the same population that was present before the 1980âs (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). A summer 2009 oceanic survey covering waters from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in an estimate of 2,415 Short-finned Pilot Whales (CV 0.66) (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2016). Two line transect surveys conducted in the summer of 2011 in the western Atlantic from central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy yielded an estimate of 21,515 (CV 0.37) (Palka 2012. Garrison and Rosel 2017). Because this 2011 survey was the first in this region to distinguish between&#160;Short-finned and Long-finned Pilot Whales&#160;where the species overlap in range (Rone and Pace 2012, Garrison and Rosel 2017), comparison with earlier estimates to assess trends is not possible (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are among the most frequently encountered cetaceans in the Canary Islands, although absolute estimates of abundance are not available (Carrillo <em>et al. </em>2010). They have been described as ârelatively abundantâ around the Maldives and in the northern Indian Ocean more generally (Ballance and Pitman 1998, Clark<em> et al.</em> 2012). Although there has been limited survey effort, the compiled records suggest that Short-finned Pilot Whales occur regularly in deep water off the west coast of Africa (Weir 2010).<br/><br/>While the estimates presented here give insight into abundance for some populations, there is no information on global numbers or trends (Olson 2018).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are found in warm temperate to tropical waters, generally in deep offshore areas. They do not usually range north of 50Â°N or south of 40Â°S (Olson 2018). There is some distributional overlap with Long-finned Pilot Whales, which occur primarily in cold temperate to subpolar waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017, Olson 2018).<br/><br/>Two forms of Short-Finned Pilot Whale are found off Japan with partially overlapping distributions (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2016). There is only one confirmed record of the species in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2016, Verborgh<em> et al.</em> 2016), and records from the southern Red Sea are considered uncertain and unconfirmed (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017). There are no confirmed accounts of <em>Globicephala</em> in the Persian Gulf (Leatherwood<em> et al.</em> 1991, de Boer<em> et al.</em> 2003, Preen 2004).

50356660,9461,Grampus griseus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-02-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Rissoâs Dolphin is a widely distributed species that occurs throughout tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These dolphins appear to favour continental slope habitat but also occur at lower densities in oceanic and continental shelf waters. The sum of existing abundance estimates is about 350,000 individuals, but as these estimates are from only a small fraction of the total distribution range of the species, actual abundance is likely much higher. Threats that may be causing declines include bycatch in offshore gillnets, pelagic longlines, and other fishing gear. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates, but it is clear that this species is taken in small or moderate numbers in several countries throughout its range. However, given its wide distribution and considerable abundance, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the speciesâ extensive range, the Rissoâs Dolphin is assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. There is not enough information to rule out the possibility that the global population has declined by 30% or more over three generations (60 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) and if that were the case it would qualify for listing as Vulnerable. Therefore, further monitoring is encouraged and this assessment should be regarded as provisional, pending better information particularly regarding incidental mortality in fisheries.","<p>Rissoâs Dolphins inhabit deep oceanic and continental slope waters, generally 400-1,000 m deep (Baumgartner 1997, Hartman 2017, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, 2014). They frequent sub-surface seamounts and escarpments, where they are thought to feed on vertically migrant and mesopelagic cephalopods. In Monterey Bay, California, Risso's Dolphins are concentrated over areas with steep bottom topography (Kruse 1989). Currents and upwelling causing local increases in marine productivity may enhance feeding opportunities, resulting in the patchy distribution and local abundance of this species worldwide (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Davis <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Baumgartner (1997) reported that in the Gulf of Mexico, Risso's Dolphins were mostly found along the upper continental slope, which may reflect mesopelagic squid distribution. Most records of Rissoâs Dolphins&#160;in Britain and Ireland are within 11 km of the coast. They are known to occur during summer in shallow (occasionally &lt;10m in depth) coastal waters where they feed on Common Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis)</em> along the French coast of the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Long-term changes in the occurrence of Rissoâs Dolphins in some areas (e.g., off Catalina Island and in central California) have been linked to ocean conditions and movements of spawning squid (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Risso's Dolphins mostly feed on mesopelagic and benthic cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus (Cockroft <em>et al. </em>1993). In the few areas where feeding habits have been studied, they appear to feed mainly at night (Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011, Wang <em>et al. </em>2012). Rissoâs Dolphins likely take advantage of the circadian vertical movements of their prey, particularly mesopelagic squid (Soldevilla <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>In Sri Lanka, Risso's Dolphins were, at least during the 1980s, the third most commonly taken cetacean in fisheries, providing meat for human consumption and fish bait (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Leatherwood 1994). Around 15% of the estimated 9,000 cetaceans landed annually in Sri Lanka between 1984-1986 were Rissoâs Dolphins, most of them having been caught in gillnets or harpooned (Leatherwood 1994). In Japan, Risso's Dolphins are taken regularly by hand harpoon and driving, in set nets, and as a limited catch in the small-type whaling industry, with reported catches in recent years ranging from about 250â500 (Kasuya 2018). In 2007/2008, 246 Rissoâs Dolphins were reported to have been taken by the harpoon fishery operating off Hokkaido, Sanriku, Boso, and Kii (Kazuya 2018). They are also a major target of artisanal hunting and are taken incidentally in gillnets and other fishing gear in the Philippines and China (Dolar 1994, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). Off eastern Taiwan, Rissoâs Dolphins are taken opportunistically by harpoon and they are caught incidentally in large-mesh driftnets for large pelagic fish (Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 2012, several groups of Rissoâs Dolphins were intentionally killed in the Faroe Islands (Bloch <em>et al. </em>2012) where Long-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) and Atlantic White-sided Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus acutus</em>) are the primary targets of the drive hunt for cetaceans.<br/><br/>Bycatch occasionally occurs in pelagic longline fisheries in the southwestern Indian Ocean and along the U.S. Atlantic coast, particularly since Rissoâs Dolphins regularly depredate squid used as bait (Garrison 2007, Kiszka 2015). Between 2011 and 2012, several Rissoâs Dolphin deaths were recorded in the pelagic longline fishery based in La Reunion (Sabarros <em>et al. </em>2013). In Tanzania, bycatch has been recorded in drift gillnet fisheries targeting tuna, billfish, sharks, and other large pelagic fish off Zanzibar and Pemba (J. Kiszka, unpublished data). Bycatch in gillnets has also been documented in Ghana, the Azores, Peru, and the Solomon Islands (Bearzi <em>et al. </em>2011, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reeves <em>et al. </em>2013). Bycatch rates of Rissoâs Dolphins in the Swordfish and Thresher Shark gillnet fishery off California are considered relatively low based on observer data (Carretta and Enriquez 2012).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales (Ziphiidae), which are also deep-divers that prey on cephalopods, Rissoâs Dolphins are likely susceptible to disturbance by loud anthropogenic sound, such as that generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al. </em>2006, Modest 2015, Southall <em>et al</em>. 2016). They are also exposed to disturbance by whale-watching boats (Visser <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Rissoâs Dolphins in the Mediterranean carry substantial contaminant burdens (Kim <em>et al</em>. 1996, Marsili and Focardi 1997).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global abundance for Rissoâs Dolphins, but there are estimates for some specific areas. Surveys off California in 1991 and 1992 found estimated abundance to be almost an order of magnitude higher in winter (N=32,376, coefficient of variation (CV)=46%) than in summer (N=3,980, CV=57%) (Forney and Barlow 1998). The current stock assessment for this species along the Pacific coast of the U.S. was calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys to give an abundance estimate of 6,336 (CV=32%) animals (Barlow 2016). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 7,256 (CV=41%) (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Based on surveys conducted from 1986 to 1990, 175,800 (CV=38%) Rissoâs Dolphins were estimated in the eastern tropical Pacific (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). The best abundance estimate for Rissoâs Dolphins in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic is 18,250 (CV=46%) based on surveys in 2011 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2016), with an additional 1,589 (CV=27%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on surveys in 2003 and 2004 (Waring <em>et al. </em>2009). Aerial surveys on the European continental shelf in summer 2016 (SCANS-III) generated an estimate of 11,069 Rissoâs Dolphins (CV=51%), with highest densities off eastern Ireland and northwestern Scotland (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In the northern Indian Ocean, Ballance and Pitman (1998) recorded Rissoâs Dolphin as the fourth most abundant cetacean species, in Tanzania in the western Indian Ocean it was the second most frequently encountered species after the Spinner Dolphin (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is one of the most common species in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). Estimates based on indices of relative abundance of Rissoâs Dolphins off Sri Lanka from 1980 to 1984 ranged from 5,500 to 13,000 animals (Kruse <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1991). Recent surveys suggest a possible decline of Rissoâs Dolphins off Sri Lanka, particularly along the south coast (Anderson 2013). In the eastern Sulu Sea in 1994-1995, Dolar <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance at 1,514 (CV=55%). There were estimated to be 83,300 (CV=17%) Rissoâs Dolphins in three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan between 1983 and 1991 (Miyashita 1993). Extensive aerial surveys conducted in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2009 and 2010 produced abundance estimates for the Seychelles (17,115 individuals, CV=28%), the Mascarene islands (554, CV=86%), and the northern (298, CV=74%), central (3,107, CV=33%), and southern (3,141, CV=33%) Mozambique Channel (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017). The sum of the above abundance estimates is around 350,000, however, as these surveys covered only a small proportion of the total range of the species, total range-wide abundance is likely to be substantially higher.<br/><br/>There is no information on global trends in abundance. However, decreases may have occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009) and along the west coast of the U.S. (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2009). In the late 1950s, Risso's Dolphins were rarely encountered in the Southern California Bight, and between 1975 and 1978 they were still considered to be a minor part of the cetacean fauna, representing only 3% of the cetaceans observed (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). After the El NiÃ±o event of 1982/83, however, numbers of Risso's Dolphins increased, especially around Santa Catalina Island where they came to be considered common (Shane 1995). In Sri Lanka, tuna drift gillnet fisheries may have caused a dramatic decline of Rissoâs Dolphins (Kruse <em>et al.</em> 1991). The species is currently very rare there, while it was reported as abundant in the 1980s (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Anderson 2013).</p>",Unknown,"The Rissoâs Dolphin&#160;is a widely distributed species that primarily inhabits waters of the continental slope and outer shelf (especially areas with steep bottom topography) in the tropics and temperate regions of both hemispheres (Baumgartner 1997, Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999, Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). It also occurs in oceanic areas (beyond the 2,000 m depth contour) such as in the eastern tropical Pacific, in the northeastern Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017), in the western Indian Ocean and in the northwestern Pacific (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). In the north of its range, Rissoâs Dolphins have also been recorded from Newfoundland, Norway, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Gulf of Alaska. In the south, they have been recorded off the tip of South Africa, southern Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and to 40-50Â°S off both coasts of South America (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Their range includes many semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of California, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Sea of Japan, and Mediterranean Sea. In a number of regions, Rissoâs Dolphins can be encountered in the shallow waters of the continental shelf, such as in the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2004, 2007) and the Celtic Sea (Reid <em>et al. </em>2003). They are relatively rare along the Atlantic coast of South America (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014).","<p>This species is (or has been) hunted for food in some places around the world, including in the Caribbean, Japan, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. </p>",Marine,"<p>The Rissoâs Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

50361866,11145,Lagenorhynchus obliquidens,Least Concern,,2018,2018-05-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Pacific White-sided Dolphin&#160;is widespread and abundant throughout deeper waters of the North Pacific. The sum of current abundance estimates is several hundred thousand, but as abundance has not been estimated for large parts of the species range actual abundance is likely to be substantially higher. Although bycatch in high-seas drift gillnet fisheries during the 1970s and 1980s may have caused population declines, these fisheries have been banned since 1993. Current takes from bycatch and direct hunts appear to be small relative to reported global population size. The power to detect declines for this species is low because abundance estimates are imprecise, but in the main region where data are available (California) a decline in abundance of 22% in 10 years was reported (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015). This decline was attributed to changing ecosystem and oceanic conditions (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is evidence for a significant decrease in herring spawning stock biomass in California waters since the 1980s (Schweigart <em>et al</em>. 2010) and it has been suggested that adult survival of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in British Columbia is strongly linked to inter-annual variability in herring abundance (Ashe 2015). </p>  The Pacific White-sided Dolphin was listed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern in 2008. The large decline in abundance observed off California is of concern, but at present there is no evidence that this affects the&#160;species&#160;in&#160;a significant part of its range. Given the moderately high abundance and wide distribution in the North Pacific, the apparent lack of&#160;pervasive&#160;threats, and relatively low documented levels of bycatch in fishing gear, this species is again listed as Least Concern.","<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit temperate oceanic waters across the North Pacific, as well as shelf and slope waters of the North Pacific continental margins (see distribution plots in Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006 and Best <em>et al.</em> 2015), and in some inland waterways in British Columbia (Heise 1997a, Morton 2000, Ashe 2015) and southeast Alaska (Dahlheim <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p><p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins feed on a wide variety of small pelagic schooling fishes (e.g. lanternfish, anchovies, saury, horse mackerel, herring, and hake) as well as salmon and cephalopods (Heise 1997b, Morton 2000). They commonly occur in association with other marine mammal species, particularly Northern Right Whale Dolphins (<em>Lissodelphis borealis</em>), Risso's Dolphins (<em>Grampus griseus</em>), and California Sea Lions (<em>Zalophus californianus</em>) (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p>","<p>Historically, the greatest threats to Pacific White-sided Dolphins were the high-seas drift gillnet fisheries for salmon and squid, which operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35ËN and 47ËN (Hobbs and Jones 1993). Effort in those fisheries increased during the 1970s and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium went into effect in January 1993. Bycatch estimates are available for only a subset of the total fishing effort at that time. The Japanese squid driftnet fishery killed an estimated 6,100 animals during 1989, and all five high-seas squid driftnet fisheries combined killed an estimated 5,759 during 1990 (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the high-seas driftnet fisheries combined likely killed on the order of 100,000 Pacific White-sided Dolphins. Although there is great uncertainty in the total population size, these bycatch levels may have caused some, but likely not substantial, population depletion (Hobbs and Jones 1993).</p><p>Smaller catches (e.g., at least 194 in 1987) are reported from the Japanese land-based salmon drift net fishery, and small numbers are taken yearly in seines, set nets, and trap nets around Japan (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pacific White-sided Dolphins have never been the primary targets of Japanese drive fisheries, but they were harpooned in Japanese waters during the 1940s, and culling programs killed at least 466 Pacific White-sided Dolphins in Japanese waters between 1976 and 1980.</p><p>In the eastern Pacific, a total of 424 Pacific White-sided Dolphins were estimated killed in the U.S. West Coast shark and swordfish driftnet fishery between 1988 and 2002 (Perkins <em>et al</em>. 1994, Julian and Beeson 1998, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005). Additional low levels of mortality have been documented for bottom-set gillnets in California coastal waters, for drift gill nets in California and Alaska, and for trawl fisheries in Alaska; however, no overall mortality estimates are available for those fisheries. It is estimated that about one Pacific White-sided Dolphin per year is killed in the California drift gillnet fishery (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the eastern Pacific, 28 Pacific White-sided dolphins were recorded as killed in scientific trawls off California between 2011-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). The sustainable limit to mortality for this population were estimated at 191 individuals per year (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017) using the Potential Biological Removal calculation (Wade 1998). An estimated four individuals were killed due to vessel strikes from 2010 to 2014 (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2016). None of these sources of mortality appears to be of a sufficient magnitude to have caused a population decline in the eastern North Pacific.</p><p>Mortality of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia is thought to be below the sustainable limit, but not all fisheries are monitored, observer coverage is sparse in monitored fisheries, and species misidentification introduces uncertainty when estimating anthropogenic mortality for this species (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). In inshore waters of British Columbia, photo-identification photographs collected from 2008 to 2013 were examined for fishery-related injuries and about 0.5% of individual Pacific White-sided Dolphins were found to have injuries consistent with fishery interactions (Ashe 2015).</p>  <p>Blubber samples from five stranded Pacific White-sided Dolphins off Japan were found to have high (690 ng/g lipid weight) concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether when compared to other small cetaceans sampled in the region (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2006). </p>  A decline in the presence of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in the southwestern Gulf of California from 1989 to 2009 is thought to be associated with warming SST in the region, suggesting that Pacific White-sided Dolphins are particularly vulnerable to climate change (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, more research in needed to determine whether this shift in distribution is permanent.","<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins are among the most abundant pelagic dolphins in the cold-temperate North Pacific; they are common both on the high seas and along continental margins (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Black 2018). Two separate estimates of abundance have been made for the central North Pacific, suggesting that 900,000â1,000,000 Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit this oceanic region (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993, Miyashita 1993). The estimate reported in Buckland <em>et al</em>. relies on data collected between 1987 and 1990 and thus is now outdated (&gt; 25 years old), plus precision was low for both studies, and vessel attraction probably resulted in a substantial overestimate of population size (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993).</p><p>There is genetic evidence supporting separate subpopulations in the southern portions of the species range, off the west coast of North America (Lux <em>et al</em>. 1997, Soldevilla <em>et al.</em> 2008) and in Japan (Hayano <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is also evidence for further genetic subdivision as follows: 1) Baja California, Mexico; 2) California, Oregon, and Washington; 3) an âoffshoreâ stratum on the international high seas; and 4) the west coast of Canada and southeast Alaska (Lux <em>et al</em>. 1997).</p><p>In the eastern North Pacific, the distribution of this species has been documented to vary dramatically with ocean conditions (Heise 1997a, Forney and Barlow 1998, Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Abundance in waters off California, Oregon, and Washington was 23,817 (coefficient of variation (CV)=0.36) for pooled estimates from summer and fall months between 1991 and 2005 (Forney <em>et al.</em> 1995, Barlow and Forney 2007). The most recent abundance estimate (geometric mean of estimates) from this region, based on surveys in 2008 and 2014, was 26,814 (CV=0.28) (Barlow 2016, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;</p><p>Information on trends in abundance is available for one part of the speciesâ range. Line-transect surveys conducted year-round as part of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation off southern California estimated an average of 12,371 (CV=0.27) Pacific White-sided Dolphins in the survey region over the period July 2004âNovember 2013 (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). Comparison of annual density estimates from 2004 to 2013, after accounting for seasonal differences, demonstrated a mean annual population change of -22.5% (95% confidence interval -35% to -9%), a statistically significant decline in the study area over the 10-year period (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). Average density was estimated at 51.98/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=0.27) and decreased from a peak of 93/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=0.56) in 2005 to a low of 4.6/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=07) in 2012. Pacific White-sided Dolphins were the third most frequently encountered species in the study area, but the only one of six cetacean species for which abundance was estimated that showed evidence of population decline (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). The authors concluded that the long-term, significant decreasing trend observed for this species over the last decade does not appear to be driven only by sea surface temperature (SST), but by a suite of variables including but not limited to SST.</p><p>Abundance on continental shelf waters of the Canadian Pacific region was estimated to be about 25,900 (CV=0.35) in surveys in summer 2004 and 2005 (Williams and Thomas 2007). Additional years of survey effort in the same study area did not provide any evidence for a trend between 2004 and 2008, but the precision of the estimates was low (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015). Estimates of abundance for Pacific White-sided Dolphins from photo-identification studies in coastal waters off northeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia were highly variable between 1990 and 2013, and ranged from about 985 (CV=0.55) to 2005 (CV=0.31) individuals (Ashe 2015).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit temperate waters of the North Pacific and some adjacent seas including the Sea of Japan, southern Okhotsk Sea, southern Bering Sea, and southern Gulf of California (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Black 2018). Their range includes continental slope waters of the western North Pacific as far south as southern China and Taiwan, shelf and slope waters of the eastern North Pacific from the Gulf of Alaska southward to Baja California, Mexico, and deep offshore waters of the North Pacific between about 35ËN and 47ËN latitude (Hobbs and Jones 1993, Black 2018). Pacific White-sided Dolphins generally inhabit productive continental shelf and slope waters within 185 km of shore (Black 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Distribution appears to change seasonally in many places, probably linked to changes in water temperature and distribution of prey. The probability of sighting Pacific White-sided Dolphins in southeast Alaska appears to increase in spring (Dahlheim <em>et al</em>. 2009). Along the continental shelf of British Columbia (BC), Canada, Pacific White-sided Dolphin abundance showed no major seasonal differences in density among spring, summer, or fall surveys (Best <em>et al</em>. 2015). On a finer spatial scale, Morton (2000) reported an increase in sighting probability of this species in the fjords of BC in spring and fall.&#160;</p>  <p>Similarly, Pacific White-sided Dolphin sightings off southern California peaked during cooler water temperatures of spring (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2014), which is likely to be due in part to the strong correlation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with fluctuations in the occurrence of small pelagic fish (Lehodey <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;</p>  Pacific White-sided Dolphin distribution is strongly associated with fluctuations in prey and water temperature in waters off Japan near Hokkaido (Iwahara <em>et al.</em> 2017).",This species is no longer the target of direct harvesting effort.,Marine,"<p>The Pacific White-sided Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p><p>The most significant international conservation measure for this species was the United Nations moratorium on high-seas driftnet fishing implemented in 1993.

The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern.

Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41Â°-44Â°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) Â­â 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) â 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>.

(2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas.

The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Ãien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (JonsgÃ¥rd 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wadeâs totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.âs, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170Â°E to 135Â°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committeeâs multi-year âcomprehensive assessmentâ of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated âpre-whalingâ population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armaÃ§Ãµes) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55Â°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40Â°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committeeâs recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> MagnÃºsdÃ³ttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whaleâs summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian â Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American â Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28Â°N 129Â°E) and HachijÅ-jima Island (33Â°N 140Â°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (UrbÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5Â°N, 2Â°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commissionâs Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo SÃ£o Roque (5Â°S) to Cabo Frio (23Â°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20Â°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, RÃ©union and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: âThe combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some âgroupsâ that may [eventually] be designated as species.â <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Biggâs Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (CaÃ±adas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38Â° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back â a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back â a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48Â°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important âpreyâ fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (CaÃ±adas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canadaâs Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257â373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore âminimumâ counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) â resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) â residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Ãien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and SigurjÃ³nsson 1990, SigurjÃ³nsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales â one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60Â°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, IÃ±Ã­guez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (SigurjÃ³nsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50370912,17032,Phocoenoides dalli,Least Concern,,2018,2017-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Dallâs Porpoise is widespread and abundant, with current range-wide population estimates of more than one million animals. These porpoises were killed in large numbers incidentally in high-seas driftnet fishing operations during the 1970s and 1980s, but those fisheries have now been banned, and in most cases, by-catch levels are not now considered sufficiently high to cause population declines. While significant incidental and directed takes in Japanese coastal waters, as well as incidental takes in Russian waters, are ongoing (with combined removals on the order of 20,000 annually, which likely impact local stocks), neither threat is likely to have caused a range-wide decline sufficient to warrant listing in a threatened category. Therefore, given its generally high abundance and fairly wide range, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the range, the Dallâs Porpoise is assessed for the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.","This species inhabits mainly offshore deep waters colder than 18Â°C (Miyashita and Kasuya 1988), but may also occur in narrow channels and fjords in the western North Pacific (Jefferson 1988, Rice 1998). <br/><br/>Sex-biased dispersal is known to occur in this species, and this may have relevance in assessing the impact of takes on regional populations (Escorza Trevino and Dizon 2000).<br/><br/>Dall's Porpoises are apparently opportunistic feeders, taking a wide range of surface and midwater fish and squid, especially soft-bodied species like lanternfishes (myctophids) and gonatid squids. Krill, decapods, and shrimps found in porpoise stomachs occasionally are not considered normal prey (Houck and Jefferson 1999, Jefferson 2002).","The main threats to this species have been incidental takes by salmon and squid driftnet fisheries and directed takes by the hand harpoon fishery in Japanese coastal waters (Jefferson 2018). The Japanese salmon driftnet fisheries began in 1952 and continued until a United Nations moratorium on all high-seas driftnet fisheries came into effect in the 1990s (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). The large-mesh and squid driftnet fisheries operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35ËN and 47ËN; they increased in effort during the 1970s and peaked during the 1980s prior to the moratorium. Bycatch estimates are available only for 1989â1990, when an estimated 4,000 Dall's Porpoises were killed per year (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the combined high-seas driftnet fisheries cumulatively killed tens of thousands in the central/western North Pacific. Although this level was not considered to have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993), Kasuya (2017) stated that, considering the uncertainties around actual mortality levels and abundance, the driftnet fisheries probably did affect at least some of the Dallâs Porpoise populations. The estimated annual take by the Japanese salmon fishery within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for the period 1981-1987 ranged from 741 (1987) to 4,187 (1982), with smaller additional takes in Bering Sea waters outside of the U.S. EEZ (IWC 1991; T.A. Jefferson unpubl. data). These salmon driftnet fisheries currently operate in waters of the Russian EEZ, and continue to take about 1,300 Dallâs Porpoises per year there (Artukhin <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/> <br/> Incidental catches on the order of thousands of porpoises (mainly Dallâs Porpoises but also including some Harbor Porpoises) per year are ongoing in several fisheries using gillnets in the Russian EEZ (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). Small numbers of Dall's Porpoises are also taken along the Canadian and US west coasts in driftnet and trawl fisheries (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/> <br/> The Japanese hand harpoon fishery for Dallâs Porpoises started in the 1910s (Ohsumi 1972, Sawadate 1983) and had a great expansion around the time of World War II (Wilke <em>et al</em>. 1953, Sawadate 1983), after which kills remained at 5,000â10,000 per year until the 1970s (Kasuya 1982). Approximately 111,500 Dallâs Porpoises were removed by hunting between 1986 and 1989 from two stocks centered in the Okhotsk Sea (IWC 1991). The peak year of this directed fishery was considered to be 1988, when an estimated 45,600 porpoises were taken, significantly more than the official figures reported by the Japanese government (Kasuya 2017). The Japanese government began to regulate the hand harpoon fishery in 1989, and a catch quota was introduced in 1993. The fishery currently operates with quotas of 9,000 for the <em>dalli</em>-type Sea of Japan-southern Okhotsk Sea population and 8,700 for the <em>truei</em>-type Pacific coast-central Okhotsk Sea population (IWC 2002). The current levels of reported takes are about 4% of the mean estimates of the sizes of the populations; however, statistics on removals might not be reliable (Kasuya 2007, 2017). If actual catches are greater, then there is a strong likelihood of population declines. The history of the fishery, quotas, and catch levels were summarised by Kasuya (2017).<br/> <br/> Environmental contaminants are thought to be a threat in some areas, and high levels of organochlorines in particular may reduce testosterone levels in males and affect calf viability, thereby influencing reproduction and survival (Subramanian <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1988).","Dallâs Porpoises are common in many cooler portions of the North Pacific, and density is high in many parts of the range. Total abundance is probably over 1.2 million individuals (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the coastal inshore waters of British Columbia, there is an estimated total of 4,913 (coefficient of variation (CV)=29%) (Williams and Thomas 2007). Along the U.S. west coast (California, Oregon, and Washington), the abundance estimates from multiple surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005 ranged from about 35,000 to 134,000, averaging 86,000 animals (CV=45%) (Barlow and Forney 2007). The most recent estimate of Dallâs Porpoise abundance for that coast is 25,750 (CV=45%), calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys (Barlow 2016. Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Alaska, the abundance is estimated at 83,400 (CV=10%) (Angliss and Outlaw 2005. Muto <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the western North Pacific, the offshore <em>dalli</em>-type population numbers approximately 162,000 (Kasuya 2017). The <em>truei</em>-type population migrating between the Pacific coast of Japan and the central Okhotsk Sea is estimated at 178,000 (CV=23%) (Kasuya 2017). The <em>dalli</em>-type population migrating between the Sea of Japan and the southern Okhotsk Sea is estimated at 173,000 (CV=21%), and the <em>dalli</em>-type population summering in the northern Okhotsk Sea at 111,000 (CV=29%) (IWC 1998, Kasuya 2017). However, some of these estimates are subject to upward biases due to positive responsive movement toward survey vessels. <br/> <br/> The International Whaling Commissionâs Scientific Committee currently recognizes 11 stocks of this species, based on differences in genetics, pollutant loads, parasite faunas, and distribution patterns of mother/calf pairs (IWC 2002). Three of them summer in the Okhotsk Sea, two in the Bering Sea, four in the central North Pacific, and two off the U.S. west coast. The wintering grounds are unknown for many of these populations. The populations cannot be reliably distinguished by their external appearance at sea except for the three summering in the Okhotsk Sea, which are distinguishable based on pigmentation and location.",Unknown,"Dall's Porpoises are found only in the northern North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Bering and Okhotsk seas, and in the Sea of Japan. They inhabit deep waters between about 30Â° and 62Â°N (Jefferson 1988. Houck and Jefferson 1999), but occasionally occur as far south as about 28Â°N off the coast of Baja California (Mexico) during unusually cold-water periods. <br/><br/>The <em>P. d. <em>dalli</em></em> subspecies is the more widely distributed form, and it occurs throughout the speciesâ range, from the west coast of North America to Japan, Korea and Russia. <br/><br/>The <em>P. d</em>. <em>truei</em> subspecies is identified by a more extensive lateral white patch, and it inhabits only the western North Pacific. The <em>truei</em> subspecies migrates between wintering grounds off the Pacific coast of northern Japan and summer breeding grounds in the central Okhotsk Sea. It constitutes a single population (IWC 2002).",This species is hunted commercially in Japan.,Marine,"The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES. Dallâs Porpoise are also protected by generally applicable marine mammal legislation in Canada and the United States. Catches of Dallâs Porpoises in the Japanese salmon driftnet fishery were limited to some extent by quotas set by the U.S. government, because until the early 1990s the fishery took place largely within U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters of the Aleutian Islands. There was a large-scale fishery observer program and extensive biological research associated with this fishery in the late 1970s and 1980s (Jones 1984, Ferrero and Walker 1999).<br/> <br/> The long period since the last abundance survey (over 15 years) means that reassessment of the status of the two populations hunted in the Japanese hand harpoon fishery is needed. Kasuya (2017) summarized information suggesting that both of those populations have decreased in size from the early 1990s to the late 2000s, though thorough biological reviews and status assessments have not been conducted in recent years. The Japanese government sets quotas for this fishery, but these are based on optimistic assumptions about rates of population increase. As such, they could still result in the depletion of populations (Kasuya 2017).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50374282,20731,Stenella coeruleoalba,Least Concern,,2019,2018-04-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Striped Dolphin is one of the most abundant cetaceans in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters around the globe. The sum of available abundance estimates totals more than two million individuals. Estimates are unavailable for most of the species range, particularly in the eastern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and large portions of the tropical Pacific and therefore total abundance is likely much higher. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates in most range states, but bycatch certainly occurs in much of the speciesâ range. Recent evidence suggests that bycatch levels are low in purse seine fisheries of the eastern tropical Atlantic and in the western Indian Ocean. The species has suffered two epizootics in the Mediterranean that caused the deaths of thousands of individuals. Direct removals are substantial in a few areas, notably drive hunts in Japan. The Mediterranean subpopulation of Striped Dolphins is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a suspected reduction in population size of &gt;30% that occurred over the last three generations (approximately&#160;60 years) (criterion A2) based on a 2/3 reduction in mean school size (A2b), a decline in quality of habitat, particularly food availability (A2c), past and current high levels of exploitation in the form of incidental mortality in fisheries (A2d), and the effects of pathogens and pollutants (A2e). </p>Globally, the species remains widely distributed and abundant and it is unlikely that the global population has been, or will be, reduced by as much as 30% over three generations. Striped Dolphins were classified as Least Concern (LC) on the Red List in 2008, and although the species is data-poor in much of its range, given its generally high abundance and pantropical distribution, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout its extensive range, the Striped Dolphin is again assessed as LC.","<p>Striped Dolphins occur primarily in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceanic regions far from shore. They are seen close to shore only where deep water approaches the coast (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Archer 2018). In the North Pacific, Striped Dolphins are associated with oligotrophic waters of the central North Pacific gyre and with more productive upwelling areas in the ETP and along the edges of the California and Kuroshio Current systems (Miyazaki <em>et al</em>. 1974, Reilly 1990, Archer and Perrin 1999, Ballance <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the western North Atlantic, Striped Dolphins appear to prefer continental slope waters offshore of the Gulf Stream (Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1976, Schmidly 1981, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Mediterranean, they are associated with highly productive, oceanic waters beyond the continental shelf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 1993, Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1994, Frantzis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gannier 2005, Panigada <em>et al.</em> 2008). Off South Africa, the species is oceanic, occurring beyond the continental shelf at depths of over 1,000 m, and its distribution is correlated with the warm Agulhas Current (Ross 1984). Within the Mediterranean, there is some evidence of population structure based on restricted gene flow and significant differences in tissue pollutant levels between areas (Calzada and Aguilar 1995, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Gaspari 2004). The species has been reported in waters from 10Â°C to 26Â°C, although most records are from about 18Â°C to 22Â°C (Archer and Perrin 1999).<br/> <br/>The diet of Striped Dolphins consists of a wide variety of small, midwater and pelagic or benthopelagic organisms, especially lanternfish, cod, and squid (Wurtz and Marrale 1993, Hassani <em>et al</em>. 1997, Archer 2018). Striped Dolphins feed in pelagic to benthopelagic zones, to depths as deep as 200-700 m, in continental slope or oceanic regions.</p>","<p>The largest directed catches of Striped Dolphins have been in Japanese waters, in drive and hand-harpoon fisheries that date back to at least the Meiji period (1868-1912). Catch statistics are incomplete before 1978, but reported annual recorded catches between 1978 and 1993 ranged between 1,000 and 4,000, except for 1990 when 16,344 were reported as killed (Kasuya 2017). An annual quota of 1,000 Striped Dolphins was established in 1992, this was lowered to 725 in 1993, and there have been minor annual decreases since 2006 (Kasuya 2017). It is likely that the Japanese coastal population of Striped Dolphins suffered the highest mortality, but there is evidence based on mercury concentrations that other populations were also represented (Kasuya 1999, 2017).</p>  <p>In Taiwan, Striped Dolphins are harpooned opportunistically but these are rare events (John Wang pers. comm.). Striped Dolphins have also been taken in the drive fishery at Malaita in the Solomon Islands but they do not form a large proportion of the catch, which typically targets Spinner (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) and Pantropical Spotted (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>) Dolphins (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ross <em>et al</em>. 2003). &#160;Striped Dolphins have been taken by harpoon and gillnet in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon <em>et al</em>. 2000a,b) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/> <br/> At least until the mid 2000s illegal catches occurred in southern Spain and probably in other areas (SGFEN 2001, Aguilar 2006).</p>  <p>Striped Dolphins are killed accidentally in fishing gear throughout their range, however data are limited for most range states. Mortality occurs in purse seines and gillnets, large mesh pelagic driftnets, and pelagic longline fisheries, and has been documented in the northeastern Indian Ocean, the eastern tropical Pacific, the northeastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and in the North Pacific off the coast of Japan (Archer and Perrin 1999). Although rare, Striped Dolphins have been caught in shark nets at&#160;Natal,&#160;South Africa (Perrin <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. 1994). Between 1985 and 1988 Striped Dolphins comprised 14% of the cetaceans brought in to fish landing sites in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997).</p>  <p>High seas drift gillnet fisheries operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35ËN and 47ËN, increased during the 1970s, and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium came into effect in January 1993. Striped Dolphin mortality was highest in the Japanese large-mesh drift net fishery, with about 3,000 individuals taken in 1990 (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the high-seas driftnet fisheries likely killed tens of thousands of Striped Dolphins in total, but this mortality was not considered to have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993). In recent years, fishery-related mortality of Striped Dolphins along the U.S. east and west coasts, in Hawaii, and in the Gulf of Mexico has been low, and is considered sustainable (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Pelagic driftnets have been a major source of mortality of Striped Dolphins in the western Mediterranean in the past (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). Such nets are still illegally used by Moroccan, French, Italian, and Turkish vessels, resulting in extensive dolphin mortality (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, Silvani <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). The Spanish driftnet fishery in the AlborÃ¡n Sea reportedly killed 145-183 Striped Dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al</em>. 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which were estimated to kill in the order of 1,555-2,092 Striped Dolphins in 2003 (Tudela <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1999 and 2000, Striped Dolphins were the most commonly killed cetacean species in the Turkish driftnet Swordfish fishery (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, ÃztÃ¼rk <em>et al.</em> 2001). The Italian driftnet fishery reportedly killed 5,000-15,000 dolphins, mostly Striped Dolphins, per year in the 1980s (Di Natale 1992). The French thonaille driftnet fishery was estimated to take about 180-472 Striped Dolphins per season in year 2000 (Imbert <em>et al</em>. 2001). </p>  <p>Large incidental kills in pelagic trawl and driftnet fisheries off western Europe were a source of concern in the 1990s (IWC 1998, Tregenza and Collet 1998). Results from an observer programme on a driftnet fishery in the eastern North Atlantic in 1996 and 1998 documented marine megafauna mortality rates (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). Using landings of Albacore Tuna as an indicator of effort, the extrapolated decadal data from driftnet fleets operating in this region estimated that over the period 1990â2000 24,358 dolphins were killed, of which 12,635 (10,009â15,261) were Striped Dolphins (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the southwestern Atlantic, bycatch of Striped Dolphins was noted by Zerbini and Kotas (1998) off Brazil.</p>  <p>Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals and selenium in Mediterranean Striped Dolphins are high and exceed âsafeâ threshold levels for mammals (Cardellicchio <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Aguilar 2000, Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Organochlorine levels, in particular, greatly exceed thresholds of reproductive impairment in Bottlenose Dolphins (<em>Tursiops</em> spp.) elsewhere (Aguilar 2006, Storelli <em>et al.</em> 2012, Munson <em>et al</em>. 1998). Blubber concentrations of DDT and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, may be declining slowly (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but were still high in many parts of the Mediterranean in the early 2000s (Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, DDT and PCBs have also been reported in specimens from Japan (Tanabe <em>et al</em>. 1983). </p>  <p>Mass mortality events involving Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea occurred during 1990-1992 and 2006-2007, both caused by morbillivirus infection (Domingo <em>et al</em>. 1990, Keck <em>et al</em>. 2010). These epizootics resulted in many thousands of deaths and devastated the Mediterranean Striped Dolphin population (Bortolotto <em>et al</em>. 1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993, Raga <em>et al.</em> 2008). The primary immediate cause of the die-offs was the disease. PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with the potential for immunosuppressive effects might have played a role in, or enhanced the spread and lethality of, the first event (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). However, data from the second event did not support that hypothesis (Castrillon <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Commercially exploited fish and cephalopod species are important components of Striped Dolphin diet in the Mediterranean (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 1993, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 1995). As many of those stocks (e.g., European Anchovies) have been depleted by commercial fisheries, reduced prey availability is a potentially significant threat to the Striped Dolphin population (Aguilar 2006) and may have contributed to the 1990-1992 epizootic (Aguilar 2000). <br/> <br/> In 2004 and 2005, two unusual strandings in Taiwan included Striped Dolphins (Wang and Yang 2006). The cause(s) of the deaths of these animals were not been determined but human (but non-fishing) activities were likely responsible.","<p>Striped Dolphin abundance in the western North Pacific was estimated as 570,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 19%) based on sighting data collected during 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Two areas of Striped Dolphin concentration were identified, one between 20Â° and 30Â°N with about 52,682 animals (CV = 95%) and the other between 30Â° and 40Â°N with about 497,725 (CV = 18%) animals. In the nearshore waters of Japan, 19,631 Striped Dolphins (CV = 70%) were estimated (Kasuya 1999). </p>  <p>In the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), a 2003 line-transect survey estimated 1,470,854 individuals (CV = 15%) (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2005). The most recent estimate of abundance for waters of California-Oregon-Washington in the U.S.A., calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys, was 29,211 (CV = 0.20) animals (Barlow 2016, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). This estimate includes correction factors for animals missed during the surveys. Abundance along the U.S. west coast varies seasonally, but no long-term trends have been detected (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). A 2010 shipboard line-transect survey of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in an abundance estimate of 20,650 (CV = 0.36) Striped Dolphins (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>The total number of Striped Dolphins off the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coasts is unknown, although several estimates from specific regions for certain time periods are available (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sightings are almost exclusively in the continental shelf edge and slope areas west of Georges Bank. The best estimate for Striped Dolphins in the western North Atlantic is 54,807 (CV = 0.3) from a 2011 survey (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2014). The best available estimate for the northern Gulf of Mexico is 1,849 (CV = 0.77) from a summer 2009 survey covering waters from the 200-m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Ballance and Pitman (1998) reported that the Striped Dolphin was the second-most abundant species sighted in the western tropical Indian Ocean (14% of all cetaceans, compared to 33% for the ETP and 10% for the Gulf of Mexico). </p>  <p>Aerial and ship-board line transect surveys of European Atlantic waters in summer 2016 resulted in an estimate of 372,340 (CV = 33%) for the Striped Dolphin, which was the third most abundant species recorded. Striped Dolphins were strongly concentrated in offshore waters (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017).The Striped Dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the Mediterranean Sea. Abundance in the western Mediterranean, excluding the Tyrrhenian Sea, was estimated in 1991 at 117,880 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 68,379-214,800) (Forcada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1994). There is no estimate for the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Line transect surveys of the Pelagos Sanctuary located in the Northwest Mediterranean in August 2008 estimated Striped Dolphin population size as 13,232 (CV = 35.5% (Lauriano <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al.</em> 2009), which was only about half of that estimated by a survey conducted in 1992 in the same area with comparable effort and platform (N = 25,614; CV = 25.3%) (Forcada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1995). In the same area, two aerial surveys were conducted in winter and summer 2009 and Striped Dolphins were estimated in winter to number 19,462 (95% CI = 12,939â29,273) and in summer 38,488 (95% CI = 27,447â53,968) (Panigada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Striped Dolphin is a widely-distributed species, found in tropical to warm-temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as well as many adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Archer 2018). Northern and southern range limits are about 50Â°N and 40Â°S, although there are extralimital records from the Kamchatka Peninsula, southern Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Prince Edward Island. Striped Dolphins are uncommon in the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, off eastern Taiwan and Ryukyuan waters, and in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).

50655874,12521,Lynx rufus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bobcat is listed as Least Concern because it is abundant and wide-ranging and is not suspected to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for Near Threatened. Bobcats are widely-distributed and their current range consists of most of the United States, southern Canada, and Mexico where the state of Oaxaca remains the southern-most limit for the species. However, local threats may present challenges for long term persistence in some regions including market hunting for the fur trade, direct habitat loss caused by increased urbanization, and indirect effects of urbanization such as genetic isolation and lethal/sublethal exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (southern California). Florida is the only US state to report Bobcat declines with Bobcat observations decreasing dramatically as invasive pythons have increased in the southern part of the state. Additionally, some concern exists about sustainability of current bag limits with the increasing value of Bobcat pelts (West Virginia). Other local threats include possible disease transmission (canine distemper in Bobcats in eastern Canada), direct conflict with domestic/feral animals including feral dogs (northern Mexico), and poisoning and medicinal uses of Bobcats (central and southern Mexico). Bobcat densities are low in central and southern, compared to northern, Mexico. The recent discovery of hybridization between the Bobcat and the sympatric Canadian Lynx may result in conservation actions for the endangered lynx recovery.","In the US, the Bobcat ranges through a wide variety of habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, bottomland hardwood forest and coastal swamp in the southeast, and desert and scrubland in the southwest. Only large, intensively cultivated areas appear to be unsuitable habitat. Areas with dense understory vegetation and high prey density are most intensively selected by Bobcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The requisite features of Bobcat habitat typically include areas with abundant rabbit and rodent populations, dense cover, and shelters that function as escape cover or den sites (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Mexico, Bobcats are found in dry scrub and grassland, as well as tropical dry forest including pine, oak and fir (Monroy-Vilchis and Velazquez 2003, Arzate <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, C. Lopez-Gonzalez pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/>Like its close relative <em>Lynx canadensis</em> the Bobcat preys primarily on lagomorphs (rabbits), but is much less of a specialist. Rodents are commonly taken, and Bobcats are capable of taking larger prey, including young ungulates (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A study in Virginia found Bobcats preyed on a wide variety of species (15 total) including squirrels, chipmunks, white-tailed deer, voles, and rabbits, appearing to switch prey seasonally as certain prey items became more available (Montague 2014, Morin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in review).<br/><br/>Bobcats in New Hampshire appear to favour areas with few roads, limited human development, high stream densities, and steep topography (Broman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Similarly, Bobcats in Vermont have positive responses to shrub, wetland, deciduous, and coniferous cover types, and negative responses to road and mixed cover types, and Bobcats prefer to move through forested land and scrub/rock cover rather than move through developed land cover types (Donovan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). The recently re-established Bobcats in Iowa showed a strong preference for forest over any other habitat type (Reding <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Tucker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In Virginia, Bobcats were also shown to occur more often father away from roads (Kelly and Holub 2008). So while Bobcats can adjust to some levels of human encroachment, studies support the preference of Bobcats for vegetative cover and water in areas away from roads. Bobcat populations have been shown to decline in areas where forests have matured and no longer support abundant prey, namely cottontails (Litvaitis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Additionally, in Texas, when in the presence of Ocelots, Bobcats selected areas with &lt;75% canopy cover, likely facilitating coexistence between the two predators and demonstrating the Bobcatâs flexibility in habitat selection (Horne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Alternatively, another study has shown the Bobcat will expand its use of different environmental features and use of marginal habitat in the presence of Canada Lynx (Peers <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2009) gathered home range information from 29 Bobcat populations across the US and found that on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females. Female home ranges were 0.989â42.7 kmÂ² with a mean of 15.83 kmÂ² compared to male home ranges of 2.86â 167.9 kmÂ² with a mean of 39.70 kmÂ². Females demonstrated a strong positive association between home-range size and productivity (i.e. food availability), whereas males were influenced more by changes in size of female home ranges than by resource availability (Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Sandell 1989).","World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,&#160; $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. <br/><br/>The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160; Riley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serieys <em>et al.</em> 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Croteau <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). &#160;<br/><br/>There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi <em>et al.</em> 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton <em>et al.</em> (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani <em>et al.</em> 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne <em>et al.</em> 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers <em>et al.</em> 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack <em>et al.</em> 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.&#160; Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). &#160;<br/><br/>In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).","In 2010, Roberts and Crimmins surveyed state wildlife management agencies in each of the 48 contiguous states regarding the current population status of Bobcats. Populations were reported to be stable or increasing in 40 states, with six states unable to report population trends and only one state (Florida) reporting decreases in Bobcat populations. The total Bobcat population for the US is estimated to be between 2,352,276 to 3,571,681 individuals, indicating that Bobcat populations have increased throughout the majority of their range in North America since the late 1990s. In particular, Bobcat populations have rebounded in the Midwestern states in recent decades. Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Five Canadian provinces reported stable Bobcat populations, one reported a stable or increasing population, and one reported a fluctuating population. Bobcat population sizes and status in Mexico are not well known.<br/><br/>Despite being widespread, there are only a few estimates for the densities that bobcats can attain. Density estimates include: 57-62 / 100kmÂ² in California (Alonso <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), 48/100 kmÂ² in Texas (Heilbrun <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), 25/100 kmÂ² in Arizona (Lawhead 1984), &lt;9/100 kmÂ² in Idaho (Knick 1990), and 11/100 kmÂ² in Virginia (minimum estimate, M. Kelly and D. Morin pers. comm. 2015). Bobcat densities in the northern parts of their range are generally lower than in the south (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A density estimate for Bobcats in Mexico was low, at five individuals per 100 kmÂ² (Arzate <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Bobcat densities can vary dramatically depending on site and Thornton and Perkins (2015) found that densities in Texas were lowest in the most heavily modified landscape, and that Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover.",Stable,"Bobcats occur in southern Canada and throughout the United States and Mexico. In Canada, Bobcats appear to be extending their range northward as forest clearing occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Recent confirmation of Bobcats via remote camera, suggests Bobcat range extends further into the Canadian Rocky Mountains than previously thought (Lobo and Millar 2010). In the United States, bobcats were thought to be extirpated by the early 1900s from several Midwestern states including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri, due to habitat loss and exploitation (LariviÃ©re and Walton 1997), but they have recently recolonized these areas (Roberts and Crimmins 2010). Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Bobcats are found throughout Mexico, particularly in western Mexico and southward from the Sonoran desert. Competitive interactions with ecologically similar felids could be a factor in limiting their southern distribution, but similar competitors are present in other areas of Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Thus, the absence of<em> Lynx rufus</em> below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be due to the absence of prey species. However, confirmative data of Bobcat presence throughout Mexico is somewhat scanty. While Bobcat range is thought to stop at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Gonzalez-Salazar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), this is based on habitat modeling rather than verified confirmations. While generally favoring low and mid-elevations, in the western US, Bobcat have been trapped at elevations up to 2,575 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Mexico, radio-collared Bobcats were located at 3,500 m on the Colima Volcano in western Mexico (Burton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).","For information on use and trade , see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. The Mexican subspecies <em>Lynx rufus escuinapae</em> was listed on CITES Appendix I until 1992, when it was downlisted to Appendix II on the grounds that it is not a valid taxon (Govt of US 2007). Bobcats are legally harvested for the fur trade in 38 US states, and in seven Canadian provinces. In Mexico, the Bobcat is legally hunted in small numbers as a trophy animal (Govt of US 2007). There appears to be little illegal international trade (Govt of US 2007), although within the US, Millions and Swanson (2006) used molecular forensics techniques to determine that skins reported as originating from an area with a higher bag limit were probably illegally taken from an area with a lower limit.<br/><br/>Bobcat status in the mid-western United States has improved since their extirpation in the early 1900s. In Iowa, Bobcats were downgraded to threatened in 2001 and are now harvested in many counties. In Illinois, Bobcats were removed from the statesâ list of&#160; threatened in 1999 and they are now found in nearly all counties. Indiana has sightings in much of the state and Bobcats were downgraded to special concern in 2005. In Ohio, the Bobcat is still classified as an endangered species and provided full protection.<br/><br/>Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Island, Georgia was highly successful (Diefebach <em>et al.</em> 2013) suggesting Bobcats can do well when protected. In addition, Kapfer and Potts (2012) found Bobcat harvest in Minnesota could be predicted by season length and suggest population densities can be manipulated by change in length of hunting season.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Thus it does not qualify for Near Threatened status. However, <em>Anaxyrus boreas</em> as currently defined may comprise multiple species, and one or more of these (e.g., in the Southern Rocky Mountains) may merit threatened status if further research results in a taxonomic split.","This species is found in a wide variety of habitats including desert springs and streams, meadows, marshes, woodland, mountain wetlands and agricultural land. It is also known from around ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and slow-moving rivers and streams. It digs its own burrow in loose soil or uses those of small mammals, or shelters under logs or rocks. The eggs and larvae develop in shallow areas of ponds, lakes, or reservoirs, or in pools of slow-moving streams. The toads undertake seasonal migrations to and from breeding sites; newly metamorphosed young form&#160;large aggregations and migrate en masse to upland foraging areas.This species exhibits breeding site fidelity (COSEWIC 2012). Adult males in Alberta and a portion of northwestern Montana are unique in possessing a vocal sac and producing a loud advertisement call, while males from other parts of the range lack this structure and a true advertisement call (Pauly 2008).","Die-offs in the southern Rockies have been associated with chytrid fungus <em>(<span lang=""la"" xml:lang=""la"">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)</em>&#160;infection (Muths <em>et al</em>. 2003) which is considered a threat elsewhere throughout the species' range. Eggs are highly susceptible to the pathogenic fungus <em>Saprolegnia ferax</em>, which is most probably introduced during fish stocking (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997). In the Cascade Range of Oregon, persistent predation of adults by ravens during the toad breeding season appears to have contributed significantly to some population declines (Olson 1992). In Mexico its main threat is habitat degradation through agriculture and pollution of streams (G. Santos-Barrera pers. comm. Red List Assessment 2014).

Notably, locally adapted subpopulations often form morphologically and genetically distinct 'species pairs', some of which have been wiped out as a result of water quality degradation, invasive species, and hybridization. &#160;The species is common and has a vast range, and there are no widespread major threats. Although sub-species level conservation management is warranted for many subpopulations, <em>Gasterosteus aculeatus </em>is globally listed as Least Concern.","This species is typically found in quiet weedy pools and backwaters. It is also found in the marginal vegetation of streams, over sand and mud bottom substrates. Marine populations are pelagic, and usually found inshore along the coast, in estuaries and coastal lagoons. In some lakes, two morphologically and ecologically distinct forms may occur, differing in habitat and morphology (one littoral, the other mainly limnetic) (Taylor 1999).&#160;<br/>The species can be anadromous, but there are numerous resident populations in brackish or pure freshwater. Anadromous populations forage at sea until two years old, then move to lower parts of rivers in March-April to reproduce (van Mullem and van der Vlugt 1964). Freshwater populations usually spawn for the first time at one year. In spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes. They defend territories, in which in April-June they construct a nest on the bottom, in relatively shallow areas, very rarely attached to plants. They make a depression up to 14 Ã 10 cm to which they bring plant materials (especially filamentous algae), which are glued together with kidney secretions.&#160;Eggs are deposited in freshwater in a nest of plant material made by the male on the bottom in shallow water (Craig-Bennett 1931, Sargent and Gebler 1980). The female will typically lay a few hundred eggs and may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days (Morrow 1980).<br/>Several females are individually led to the nest to spawn, then chased away. Males guard and fan eggs to provide them with oxygenated water. &#160;Eggs hatch in 7-8 days and juveniles are guarded for a few days after which the male abandons the nest. Anadromous individuals usually die of exhaustion after spawning, while freshwater individuals are able to complete several cycles within one year or sometimes over several years. Juveniles move to sea (anadromous populations) or to deeper, larger water bodies (freshwater populations) in July-August where they form large feeding schools (Symons 1971).&#160;<br/>They feed on small aquatic invertebrates, especially insects and crustaceans (Kuiter 2000).","No major widespread threats known.

It occurs mainly in older, not clear-cut forests, both virgin and thinned forests.&#160;<em>Boletopsis grisea</em>&#160;is a&#160;well-known indicator species for long continuity of old-growth forests with high conservation value. Usually only a few mature individuals occur at each location. Individuals are considered to be very old and re-establishment of the species appears to be rare after clear-cutting. It is rarely found in pine plantations. It has been and is being negatively impacted by clear cutting and reducing areas of Scots pine old growth outside protected areas. Probably favoured by green tree retention forestry and veteran trees. Is estimated to have declined and to be continuously declining at the global scale due to decreasing area of old growth pine forests and an apparent poor ability to spread and re-establish in managed forest after clear-cutting.&#160;<br/><br/>Large scale modern forest management/clear-cutting operating in Fennoscandia, Russia and also in North America have significantly reduced and will continuously significantly reduce the potential amount of habitat. In Fennoscandia, the past, ongoing and future population decline inferred from habitat change, i.e. clear cutting, been estimated from forest statistics of potential habitat decline to be at least 15-30% in a 50-year period (three generations according to the recommendation of Dahlberg and Mueller 2011).<br/><br/>The species is, thus, globally assessed as&#160;NT (A2c+3c+4c) on account of the decline of its population size and habitat as indicated above.","<p><em>Boletopsis grisea</em> forms ectomycorrhiza with <em>Pinus</em> spp., in particular Scots pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>). It is common, but typically with only a few mycelia per stand in old-growth pine forests on sediment/sandy soils. Occurs predominately in open nutrient poor pine forests with lichens and ericaceous (<em>Calluna</em> and <em>Vaccinium</em>) undergrowth vegetation on dry acidic sandy soils. In Poland the fungus also was known to occur on inland sand dunes with pine. In France, it is reported in pine forests mixed with <em>Cedrus</em>.<br/><br/>The mycelium of the fungus is considered to be long-lived, potentially several decades to centuries, comparable to its host pine trees (Dahlberg and Mueller 2011). The mycelia of the fungus survive forest fires if their associated old tree survives.</p>","<p><em>Boletopsis grisea</em> is primarily threatened by clear-cutting of old-growth pine forests (for decline of old-growth (pine) forests, see e.g. Svensson <em>et al. </em>2019 from Sweden, Kotiaho 2017 from Finland). It is rarely observed in forest regenerated after clear-cutting. Hence conversion of old growth forests to managed forest, i.e. reduced amount of habitat, is the main cause of the decline. It is also negatively affected by nitrogen eutrophication of sandy pine forests, as well as by areal loss (expansion of urban settlements, military areas, roads etc.); see Brandrud and Bendiksen (2014) with references.<br/><br/>The major part of the potential pine habitat is in northern Europe and some parts of Russia. Around 1% of the forest is cut annually, so a conservative estimate of the potential decline of appropriate habitat is approximately 30% over 50 year period (three generations) taking into account uncertainties of numbers and size of subpopulations and rates of forest cutting in Russia and North America. It is possibly negatively affected by nitrogen fertilization of forests along with increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition (Dahlberg and Croneborg 2003).</p>","<p>The species mostly occurs in boreal old-growth dry lichen dominated sandy forests of Scots pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>) with the majority of the European localities known from Sweden and Finland and a possibly high number in Russia. In Fennoscandia is known from approx. 300 localities (50 in Norway, 100 in Sweden and 150 Finland). Not less than 100 localities are assumed to be in Russia. In North America the estimation is approx. 40 localities (GBIF 2019). There are then a total of 440 known localities, that with the not known localities could be five times more this number (2,200 localities globally estimated). The global population size is then calculated to be 22,000 (typically finding 10 mature individuals in each site).<br/><br/>Forest where it occurs are primarily threatened by clear-cutting and possibly it is also negatively affected by nitrogen fertilization of forests. The species seems to have poor ability to spread and establish in forest after clear-cutting. This is probably due to increasingly low proportion of old-growth-pine-forest where it occurs and hence lower likeliness of the species to re-establish from spores. It may also depend on that the species is considered to form long-lived individual mycelia, probably several decades and possibly several centuries old and that it evolutionary has been selected to have a slow population dynamics.<br/><br/>Historically, boreal forest fires commonly have been low-intense with a high degree of tree survival, and hence with a high likeliness for mycelia of ectomycorrhizal fungi to be very old. In Fennoscandia, old-growth pine forest is estimated to have declined &gt;15% since 1960 during the last 50 years (Svensson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019 from Sweden, Kotiaho 2017 from Finland). Clear-cutting management was introduced in large scale in these countries around 1950 and on average 1% of the productive forest land is clear-cut annually. <em>Boletopsis grisea</em> is yet only rarely observed in forest resulting from clear-cutting, hence close to seed trees or retention trees.</p>",Decreasing,"The species is widely distributed in boreal parts of Europe, Asia and North America. Its main distribution in Europe is Fennoscandia and Russia (seven regions in European part and two regions in Ural and three regions in Siberia (Asia)). It also occurs more scattered in central&#160;and SW Europe.

Also included in the Red Data Books of five regions of Russia. It is strictly protected by law in Poland.</p><p>Being an ectomycorrhizal&#160;fungus, <em>B. grisea</em> is dependent on its obligate association with pines. Although the sporocarps are short-lived,&#160;its soil-dwelling mycelia is&#160;perennial and potentially lives several decades or even centuries. With&#160;a continuity of mature Scots pine trees at a location, the mycelia can be older than the trees. It is not known why it appears not to colonize and establish in highly managed Scots pine plantations. Therefore, an appropriate conservation action is to maintain living trees and stands where it occurs to act as reserves. The fungus is adapted to withstand the regular, typically low intensity fires in boreal forests where a significant number of trees survive along with much of its the fungal mycelia that is associated with the trees.</p><p><strong><em>Recommended Action</em></strong>: Set aside Scots pine forest reserves where the species have good subpopulations. At these forests, natural or prescribed burning should be considered to maintain desired forest dynamics.</p><p>It is possible that <em>B. grisea</em> can survive timber cutting if a sufficient number and density of retention trees are preserved in a managed forest. In this case it will be critical to ensure that as many retention trees as possible are located where the mycelia of the fungus are growing, e.g. where the sporocarps have been observed.</p><p>A better understanding of the specieâs population dynamic would facilitate a better management, e.g.at what conditions it may establish, the demographic structure within populations and the pattern (and causes) of individual mycelia. Also to what degree seed trees and retention trees in managed forest may maintain the species at locations.

Examination of the stomach contents of <em>C. armatu</em>s&#160;collected by trawling at depths below 2,600 m in Hudson Canyon provided evidence that a major portion of the diet comes from the deep mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions.&#160;The largest <em>C. armatus</em> collected by trawling at depths below 2,600 m in Hudson Canyon in 1973 was 102 cm total length (Haedrich and Henderson 1974).

Habitat degradation of eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) ecosystems, in which <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>spends much of its life, could produce future concern should habitat quality and quantity decrease. Continued monitoring of eelgrass habitats is necessary to understand changes in the range and populations of <em>S. leptorhynchus</em>.<a style=""mso-comment-reference:SF_1;mso-comment-date:20140523T1355""></a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a><em></em></p>","<em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</em> is found at depths to 150 metres in near-shore eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) beds, in which it spends much of its life cycle (de Graaf 2006). It has also been documented over sand and pebble substrates (R. Pollom pers. ob.), and has been found between habitat patches, indicating mobility and dispersal between suitable habitat locations. <em>Zostera marina</em> is the most widely distributed seagrass throughout temperate waters in the Pacific (and Atlantic) oceans in the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>This species can be used as an indicator species for monitoring eelgrass habitats because of its dependency on these habitats and its important role in the biomass (as a common resident) and functional ecology (as an important role in the production of organic detritus) of eelgrass beds (Fritzsche 1980, de Graaf 2006).<br/><br/>This species feeds on small crustaceans and other zooplankton. As with most other members of the Syngnathidae, <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>relies on stealth and camouflage to catch unsuspecting prey (Flammang <em>et al</em>. 2009). Several studies have reported parasites in these fish, including Gyrodactilids (Cone <em>et al</em>. 2013) and nematodes (Moravec <em>et al</em>. 2001), though it is not clear how prevalent they are, whether they are causing a decline in fitness, or how they affect <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>populations. <br/><br/>The reproductive strategy of <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>is polygyny, in which males mate with multiple females (Wilson 2009). The species lives 1-2 years, and can have up to 12 broods of several hundred young.","<em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</em> is affected by habitat loss due to coastal development and sedimentation. There is suspected eelgrass loss across its range, significantly so in two of the coastâs largest estuaries, Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay, both home to <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>(Green and Short 2003). Eelgrass habitats are also naturally fragmented in distribution and have shown increasing fragmentation due to human activities. The fragmented nature of eelgrass habitat may affect local abundance and dispersal of <em>S. leptorhynchus</em>. Various studies have demonstrated declines in pipefish abundance with changes in water temperature, increased levels of pollution, and decreased area of eelgrass habitat (Fritzsche 1980, de Graaf 2006). In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>was found to be absent or in low abundance in eelgrass habitats where visibility was reduced due to high levels of suspended sediments. Visibility is important for successful foraging as pipefish will sit and wait for passing prey. A decreased visibility will affect this success, and therefore this species is likely vulnerable to coastal land-use practices that increase erosion (de Graaf 2006).<br/><br/>In addition to these threats to eelgrass systems, an invasive species (<em>Zostera japonica</em>) has established itself throughout most of the range of <em>S. leptorhynchus</em>. Although not predicted to directly compete with native <em>Z. marina</em>, it's unclear whether the ecosystem shifts associated with this invasive seagrass will have effects on either <em>Z. marina </em>habitat cover or <em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus </em>populations (Harrison and Bigley 1982; J. B. Marliave, Vancouver Aquarium, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Overall, eelgrass habitat loss is not considered to be a large enough threat to <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>to warrant a threatened status, as Z. marina is currently listed as Least Concern itself (Short <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species is also capable of utilizing areas with pebble or cobble substrate, but more research into how the species uses different habitat types throughout its life cycle is needed.","<p>While exact population numbers for <em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</em> are unknown, studies have reported the species as being locally common in some areas. The species has been reported as abundant in eelgrass beds sampled throughout Barkley Sound, southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia (n=30-50 at each of 17 study sites) (de Graaf 2006). They were also found to be the most abundant species collected in a study in Humboldt Bay, northern California (n=3,654 of 15,935 fish caught of 12 species; 22.4% of all fish caught) (Lomeli 2011).

68608464,63119,Amblyraja hyperborea,Least Concern,,2016,2015-08-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Arctic Skate (<em>Amblyraja hyperborea</em>) is a widespread, deepwater skate found in the North Atlantic, southwest and East Pacific, and off southern Australia in the Eastern Indian Ocean,&#160;occurring from 260 to 2,500 m. These are primarily at depths greater than most fisheries along lower continental slopes and therefore this species has apparently limited interaction with human threats. There is also no current fishery interest, although it is an occasional bycatch.<br/><br/>The species reaches a maximum size of about 1 m total length (TL), and appears to live exclusively at temperatures below 4ÂºC. In the Northwest Atlantic, this species has been taken occasionally in research trawls and in deepwater commercial fisheries off Canada. It is commonly caught during surveys on the slope of the eastern Norwegian Sea and more recently in bottom trawl surveys of the Svalbard Archipelago. Given that this species is primarily distributed outside the reach of current fishing activity and has a wide geographic range, it is assessed as Least Concern. Continued monitoring of catches and expanding deepwater fisheries, and the collection of life history data should be a priority.","The Arctic Skate is widespread in deep shelf waters and along continental slopes, and records range predominantly between 300 and 1,500 m, but reach depths of 2,500 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). This is an egg laying species, and size upon hatching is 16 to 18 cm total length (TL) (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). Maximum size reported is 107 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009); although the maximum recorded size in the Barents Sea is 74 cm TL (Dolgov 2011).<br/><br/>In Norwegian waters the highest frequency of catches observed were at depths between 1,050 to 1,250 m. In the deepest areas sampled (2,000 to 2,050 m) no catches were made, suggesting a lower limit to its depth range (SkjÃ¦raasen and Bergstad 2001). This species appears to live almost exclusively at temperatures below 4ÂºC (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). In the Barents Sea, it prefers bottom temperatures about 0Â°C (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005a).","<p>This skate is taken as bycatch in deepwater trawl and longline fisheries. In Davis Strait, it is taken as bycatch in the Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) fishery. In the Barents Sea it is taken in trawl fisheries targeting Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) and Haddock (<em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em>) at depths of 300 m, and longline fisheries targeting mainly Greenland Halibut, Blue Catfish (<em>Anarhichas denticulatus</em>) and Cod at depths around 300 m (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005b). These longline fisheries operate at depths of 130 to 847 m. Average bycatch rates in the longline fishery were 10 to 25 fish (or 35 to 75 kg) per 1,000 hooks, and this species was estimated to constitute approximately 20% of total longline catches (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005b). However, it should be noted that the uncertainty of the estimates from this method is high (approximately Â±45%). Preliminary estimates indicate that total annual skate bycatch in these fisheries is 723 to 1,891 tonnes, and the Thorny Skate (<em>A. radiata</em>) composes the great majority of catches (90 to 95% of the total skate catch). Skate catches are mainly discarded in the Barents Sea, although in 2000, about 200 tonnes of grouped Thorny and Arctic Skate were landed (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005b), so future trends should be monitored. This skate is able to find refuge at depth as it primarily occurs outside the reach of fisheries.<br/></p>","No data on population size are available, however survey data indicate that this is the dominant skate species in certain areas, such as Davis Strait and southern Baffin Bay (JÃ¸rgensen 2005, 2011). The Arctic Skate was caught commonly during research cruises conducted on the slope of the eastern Norwegian Sea from 1984 to 1987 and in 1995 (SkjÃ¦raasen and Bergstad 2001). In the Spanish bottom trawl survey carried out on the Spitsbergen/Svalbard archipelago in 2003, it was also one of the main species caught (Paz 2003). Average annual catch rate between 1992 and 2005 was 0.6 individuals per square kilometer in the Barents Sea, which is considered ârareâ (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). Between 1996 and 2001 in the Barents Sea, the largest bycatch was 60-100 kilograms (kg) per hour haul, and more than 50 individuals per 1,000 hooks (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005a). Average bycatch in the trawl fishery was 6-10 kilograms per hour haul and the maximum catch rate was 156 kg per hour. In the longline fishery, average bycatch rates were 10-25 individuals (or 35-75 kg) per 1,000 hooks, and catch rates reached 368 kg per 1,000 hooks (equivalent to a catch per vessel per day of approximately nine tonnes). These catch rates suggest that on average, this skate accounted for approximately 20% of longline catches, although they could comprise 99% of some catches. These catch rates suggest that it is a relatively common species in parts of the Northeast Atlantic. There are no data available on the population from other regions of occurrence.",Unknown,"The Arctic Skate is widespread along lower continental slopes. In the Northeast Atlantic, this species&#160;is found from the Kara Sea, the southeast Barents Sea (Franz Josef Land and northern Novaya Zemliya Archipelagos), and the Spitsbergen/Svalbard Archipelago to the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe-Shetland Ridge and northern Norway (Paz 2003, Dolgov 2013). Any records of the Arctic Skate from the North Sea and eastern English Channel<em>&#160;</em>as reported by England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2013).&#160;In the Northwest Atlantic, it occurs in Davis Strait between southwest Greenland and Canada. Recently a small number of records were reported as far south as the Grand Banks in Canadian waters, although some of these records may be confused with Jensen's Skate (<em>A. jenseni</em>). In the Southeast Atlantic, it is found along the southern tip of South Africa. In the Eastern Indian Ocean, it is found off southern Australia. In the Southwest Pacific, it occurs around New Zealand and in the Eastern Pacific it is found in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador.","The species is generally discarded, but sometimes retained, presumably for its meat.",Marine,"In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa) and North Sea (ICES sub-area IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8â25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 meters was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999â2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore not effectively constraining catches.<br/><br/>Skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters in 2009, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES sub-areas VIâIX). These TACs have also been gradually reduced since then. In 2013, the TAC for all skate and ray species grouped was 21,800 t (regulations are available online at <a href=""http://faolex.fao.org"">http://faolex.fao.org</a>).<br/><br/>Deepwater fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic have decreased in effort gradually over the past decade (Dransfeld <em>et al</em>. 2013, STECF 2014), but should still be monitored in case of future expansion, which could pose a threat to this skate.<br/><br/>Research to collect information on the biology, ecology, use, and fishery data of this species should be a priority.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

These queens emerge from hibernation in the early spring and immediately start foraging for pollen and nectar and begin to search for a nest site. Nests are often located underground in abandoned rodent nests, or above ground in tufts of grass, old bird nests, rock piles, or cavities in dead trees. Initially, the queen does all of the foraging and care for the colony until the first workers emerge and assist with these duties. Bumble bees collect both nectar and pollen of the plants that they pollinate. In general, bumble bees forage from a diversity of plants, although bumble bee species in a given area can vary greatly in their plant preferences, largely due to differences in tongue length.

In a study of blueberry fields in the Willamette Valley, Rao and Stephen (2010) found this species at four of the five fields examined, where it tied with<em> B. vosnesenskii </em>as the second most abundant <em>Bombus </em>species in trap catches (out of seven species). During visual observations of pollinator activity at these sites, this species represented 12.55% of all <em>Bombus</em> visiting blueberry flowers (Rao and Stephen 2010). No specific threats have been identified as impacting this species in North America. Bumble bees, in general, are threatened by habitat loss, pesticide use, pathogens from managed pollinators, competition with non-native bees, and climate change (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams<em> et al.</em> 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2012, FÃ¼rst <em>et al. </em>2014, Cameron<em> et al. </em>2011). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to the colonial life cycle (i.e., even large numbers of bumble bees found locally may represent only one or a few queens) (Goulson 2010, Hatfield <em>et al. </em>2012, but see Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011 and Lozier <em>et al.</em> 2011).","We evaluated this speciesâ spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Arctic/boreal species such as <em>B. frigidus</em> are already at the edge of their climatic tolerances and may be unable to respond to climate change and associated impacts via range shifts.&#160;According to NatureServe (2014), the range of this species might be expected to shift northward, probably with a net loss in suitable habitat.&#160;In addition, since species diversity is relatively low and food chains are relatively simple at cold high-elevation sites, deleterious impacts of climate-driven changes (e.g., changes in foraging resources) are likely to be more pronounced.&#160;<br/><br/>In addition to climate change, bumble bees, in general, are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss, pesticide use, pathogens from managed pollinators,&#160;and competition with non-native bees (reviewed in Goulson 2010, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2009, Williams and Osborne 2009, FÃ¼rst <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2012). Reduced genetic diversity resulting from any of these threats can be particularly concerning for bumble bees, since their method of sex-determination (haplodiploidy) can be disrupted by inbreeding, and since genetic diversity already tends to be low in this group due to the colonial life cycle (i.e., large numbers of&#160;bumble bees, locally, may represent only one or a few queens) (Goulson 2010, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Cameron <em>et al. </em>2011 and Lozier <em>et al. </em>2011).","We evaluated this speciesâ spatial distribution over time using a measure of change in the&#160;extent of occurrence (EOO; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) and a measure of change in persistence (analytical methods described in Hatfield <em>et al. </em>2014). We also assessed changes in the speciesâ relative abundance (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), which we consider to be an index of abundance relevant to the taxon, as specified by the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012).

In some regions it is common and frequent, while in others it is rare and declining. It grows mainly in forests on old living oak and beech trees and large diameter dead wood. The population size is likely to be very large since it is widespread. The species is assessed as Least Concern (LC). However, nationally and regionally it is documented to be declining due to habitat degradation and loss.","<em><span class=""species-name"">Hericium erinaceus </em>is probably a weak necrotrophic parasite on old deciduous and sclerophylous trees, mainly <em>Fagus</em> and <em>Quercus</em> (<em>Q. cerris</em>, <em>frainetto</em>, <em>gussonei</em>, <em>ilex</em>, <em>petraea</em>, <em>pubescens</em>, <em>robur</em>), more seldom also <em>Aesculus hippocastanus</em>, <em>Albizia julibrissin</em>, <em>Alnus glutinosa</em>, <em>A. incana</em>, <em>Carpinus betulus</em>, <em>Populus tremula</em>, and <em>Tilia cordata</em>. Occasionally it can also grow on <em>Betula</em>, <em>Fraxinus</em>, <em>Juglans</em>, <em>Malus</em>, <em>Ailanthus </em>and <em>Sorbus </em>(Fraiture and Otto 2015). In Europe, it preferentially grows on beech and oak in UK, Denmark, Poland,&#160;Czechia and Austria, predominantly on oak<em>&#160;</em>but also on beech<em>&#160;</em>in Slovakia, and almost exclusively on oak<em>&#160;</em>in Hungary (Kunca and Äiliak 2017). In North America, most frequently it inhabits oak, less frequently beech and occasionally other trees (Harrison 1973, Boddy <em>et al</em>. 2011). It usually colonizes trunks and thick branches through lesions and causes white rot. It can continue its growth as a saprotroph after the trees death. Therefore, fruitbodies are also found on standing broken trunks, logs and stumps. The species seems to grow in the central part of the trunk and fruitbodies develop through injuries, cracks and cuttings, etc. It is a long-lived organism as mycelium and its annual sporocarps can appear for many years at the same trunk or log. The species usually occurs in forests, and it is considered to be a good indicator for old growth beech and oak forests. However, it also occurs in other habitats, e.g., in steppe on <em>Robinia pseudoacacia</em>, or on ancient solitary veteran trees in anthropogenic habitats. The fungus is included in the list of 21 fungal indicator species of conservation value of European beech forests (Christensen <em>et al</em>. 2004). It grows both in preserved and in managed forests, but almost always on old trees. However, it has been reported also on young living beech trees.","Loss of habitats is the main threat for the fungus, decline of old growth temperate beech and oak forests, removal of old, especially badly shaped, injured or broken oak and beech trees for firewood, or phytosanitary reasons, and removing large diameter dead wood from the forest. Oak forests in Europe have been declining due to logging and changed land use (Denman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Potentially, diseases may also be a threat (Hansen and Delatour 1999). Another threat is heavy harvesting of fruitbodies because of its edibility and for medicinal purposes.","The species is widespread and abundant in the central and southeast USA (e.g., South Carolina and California) throughout the oak zone, and in central and southern France; it is also not rare in Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. However, in other European countries it is rare or very rare; it seems not to occur in the Boreal, and Arctic domains. (Dahlberg and Croneborg 2003, Fraiture and Otto 2015).&#160;In Russia (both European and Asian parts), the species is very rare. Other known Asian localities are rather scattered (the species is rare in the wild in China), although in some regions they are numerous (e.g., in East Asia and in Japan). In many countries, especially where the species is rare, decline of the locality number was reported (e.g., in Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Romania, and France). In the UK, an increase in the number of sites is mentioned (Fraiture and Otto 2015) but it reflects rather more effective site recording. The occurrence of the species strongly depends on the presence of a proper substrate - mainly old and large beech or oak trees, large diameter dead wood, and rather more humid and mild climate. It is threatened by removal of old, deformed, or damaged trees from the stands, and decline of beech and oak forests in general. Population trends in <em>H. erinaceus</em>&#160;for the application of Criterion A are assessed over 50 yrs, estimated to correspond to three generations (cf.

It is widely distributed in the the northern Hemisphere, mostly in subalpine, montane hypoarctic and boreal old-growth forests on large and old coniferous trees (e.g., <em>Larix</em>). It is commonly known as Agarikon and has since ancient times been collected for medical purposes. It is globally reported as rare or extremely rare and has declined significantly during the last centuries. <br/><br/>The species is assessed as EN under criterion A2ad because of a 70-75% population reduction in the past caused by habitat degradation and loss and collection of basidiocarps for medical purposes.&#160; It is assumed that decline will continue, but at a lower rate.","<em>Fomitopsis officinalis</em> is a tree parasite that continues to live as a saprotroph after the death of the host tree. Most frequently it occurs on different species of <em>Larix</em>, less frequently on <em>Pseudotsuga</em>, <em>Abies</em>, <em>Pinus</em>, <em>Picea</em>, <em>Tsuga</em> and <em>Cedrus</em>. With the exception of Spain, where it was found on <em>Pinus nigra </em>subsp<em>. salzmannii</em>, it occurs in Europe exclusively on larch trees: <em>Larix decidua</em>, <em>L. decidua </em>var<em>. polonica</em>, <em>L. sibirica</em>. In Asia, it grows also on <em>L. gmelinii</em> and <em>L. cajanderii</em>, and rarely on <em>Pinus sibirica</em> and <em>P. sylvestris</em>. In North America, it was found also on <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>, <em>Picea sitchensis</em>, <em>Pinus ponderosa</em>, and <em>Larix occidentalis</em>. It obviously prefers old and thick trees and hence old-growth forests predominantly in mountain areas. It causes brown rot of wood.&#160; Perennial basidiocarps have a long life up to 60-70 years (Bondartsev 1953). They grow up to 40x65 cm (Mukhin <em>et al</em>. 2005) and can reach weight up to 10 kg (PiÄtka and Szczepkowski 2004). They appear on the host tree trunk from the base up to over 20 m above, rarely on thick branches, usually in the place of infection after a few decades of its development (Konev 1972). The fungus can occur both on living trees and on their trunks and stumps after death.&#160;<br/><br/>In Europe, the species is associated mainly with virgin/old growth subalpine larch forests in the Alps, larch forests in the&#160;ÅwiÄtokrzyskie Mountains and lowland larch forests of Eastern Europe. It occurs almost exclusively in natural forests (very rarely in plantations or in parks) (Fraiture and Otto 2015). It is found most frequently on the trees suffering from environmental stress (suboptimal habitat, weakening caused by abiotic reasons or damage, the presence of some other fungal parasites) (PiÄtka and Szczepkowski 2004).","Threats to this species include logging of subalpine / montane, boreal and subarctic forests, cutting of larch forests and single old veteran trees of <em>Larix</em> spp. and other conifer hosts (also as part of regular management and removing infested/injured/ill-shaped trees); changes in the age and tree species structure of forests; degradation and loss of habitats due to different economic purposes (logging, building of tourists and sports constructions); and collection of basidiomata for medicinal purposes.","<em>Fomitopsis officinalis</em> has declined significantly during the last centuries. There are many records from different countries and continents about continuing reduction of population and decrease of habitats compared with the first half of the 20th century. Examples include: âThere are 109 records of <em>F. officinalis</em> in British Columbia since 1940 (when data collection first began), but only 19 of those records were added in the past 20 years. It remains to be determined if the reduced sightings and collections are a result of habitat loss (reduction of old growth sites)â (Callan 2000); âNeuman (1914) reported that ââvarious collectorsââ had noted <em>Fomitopsis officinalis</em> occurring on larch in northern Wisconsin. Although a few reports of this fungus have been confirmed from the Great Lakes region (Gilbertson and Ryvarden 1986), <em>F. officinalis</em> no longer is considered to occur in the Midwestâ&#160;(Lindner <em>et al</em>. 2006); Up to the 18th century the species was quite frequent in Poland, and in some places very common; in the 20th century it was almost completely eradicated and at present, only six localities are known (ÅuszczyÅska and ÅuszczyÅski 2009). âEverywhere in the Asian part of Russia it is now a rare species. During 26 years of investigation it was found only 46 times in 26 localities. Today the species is rare in regions where it earlier was common.

In Lithuania and Spain there are no records after 1968. In France, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia a decrease has been noticed for the last 50 to 100 years. A slight increase in the number of sites was reported in Switzerland, probably connected with the cessation of collecting and more sustainable forest management. In Russia, about 50 sites are registered in scientific sources, but it may occur in about 1000 sites or even more. It is widespread but rare in western North America.

The decline is due to (i) eutrophication/heavy nitrogen-deposition in large parts of Europe, (ii) habitat-loss due to urbanization and (iii) reduced habitat qualities of remaining forests due to intensive forestry with clear-cuts (i.e. in northern Europe). The element of mycorrhizal fungi in dry sandy pine forests are probably among the most threatened and declining fungal elements of Europe","<em>Tricholoma apium </em>forms mycorrhiza with Scots Pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>) in Europe, whereas it is reported from various conifers in North America (Bessette <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Europe, <em>T. apium</em> is mainly associated with dry, often lichen-dominated sandy pine forests with thin organic soils, on glacifluvial deposits, e.g. on flood-plains along the larger rivers and on eskers-ridges (formed from subglacial rivers; Brandrud and Bendiksen 2014).

It grows slowly and matures late in life (8-13 years), has an estimated generation length of 11.7-17.0 years, and&#160;produces an average of six pups per year. Based on these life history characteristics and the potential for isolation due to patchy habitat distributions and restricted movement patterns, resident stocks of Pacific Angel Shark may be vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially harvested in California beginning in the late 1970s. In response to a decline in landings, management measures (including a ban on nearshore gillnets and&#160;minimum size limits) significantly reduced the landings in California and these landings have stabilized at low levels over the past decade (2005-2014). In Mexico this species is still fished, and logbooks have been required in targeted shark fisheries since 2006. The population trend remains unknown, but reported landings data (2003-2015) from Baja California suggest that landings declines of &gt;99% may occur within three generations if current trends continue.

It lives in relatively shallow waters to depths of 100 m, but it is much more abundant in nearshore, coastal waters (Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983). They are fairly residential, restricting their movements to a small geographic area, possibly on the order of 150 ha or 375 acres, with the potential to make longer distance movements (Ebert 2003, Love 2011). For example, one Pacific Angel Shark tagged in Catalina Island was recaptured three and a half years later at Santa Cruz Island, a distance of approximately 100 km (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). They are generally quiescent during the day, often remaining buried in the sediment, but become quite active and hunt during the night (Pittenger 1984, Leet <em>et al</em>. 1992, 2001; Castro 2011). They appear to exhibit a high degree of site fidelity, with reports of sharks having preferred foraging and resting locations (Standora and Nelson 1977, Love 2011).<br/><br/>Numerous techniques of ageing and age verification have been used on Pacific Angel Shark, but none except tag-recapture have been successful at estimating their growth rates or age-specific processes (Natanson and Cailliet 1990, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). These tag-recapture data, however, allowed an estimate of von Bertalanffy growth and demography parameters that predicted relatively slow growth and moderate fecundity, with maturity occurring relatively late in life. Off California, males and females begin to mature between 90-100 cm total length (TL), with an average reproductive age of 8-13 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpublished data 2005). All males and females larger than 103 cm and 112 cm, respectively, are mature (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). In the Gulf of California, Pacific Angel Shark mature at a smaller size, 75.6 cm for males and 77.7 cm for females (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Age at maturity of the Pacific Angel Shark in California is around 10 years, but ranges from 8 to 13 years (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). The reproductive mode of this angelshark is aplacental viviparity. Females give birth to 1-13 pups (average six) after a 10 month gestation with pupping occurring between March and June (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Ebert 2003). Size at birth is approximately 25 cm TL (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). Maximum reported length is 152 cm TL for females and 118 cm for males (Natanson 1984), and maximum length in the Gulf of California was estimated at 99 cm TL (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Maximum age is around 22-35 years (Natanson 1984, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005). Generation length is estimated to be 11.7-17.0 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005).","Historically, the Pacific Angel Shark was discarded at sea or used as bait, but in the 1970s a commercial fishery in California began targeting this species. A rapid increase in Pacific Angel Shark landings between 1983-1986 occurred in California (Richards 1987), leading to concern that stocks could be overexploited. Even though a minimum size was proposed for the gillnet fishery targeting both California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) and Pacific Angel Shark, this measure proved not to be effective at reversing the declining population levels along the Santa Barbara/Ventura coast and Channel Islands areas, California (Richards 1987, Cailliet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Additionally, it was observed that declines in landings were occurring prior to the implementation of these management strategies indicating the over-exploitation of the species within the region (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In Mexico this species is caught in fisheries targeting elasmobranchs. Fishing effort in Mexico is challenging to quantify, as some fishers hold licenses but are inactive, while others may share a single license among multiple vessels (Sosa-Nishizaki, pers. comm. 2016). T<span style="""">his species is now absent from regions in Baja California Sur where it was historically found in catches (</span>Laguna San Ignacio and Bahia Magdalena<span style="""">), and there is also evidence for depensation in this region (</span>Ramirez-Amaro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013<span style="""">).</span>","No information on stock size or structure has been documented for the species. However, three genetically distinct populations have been described off of the west coast of the United States within the California Channel Islands (Northern Channel Islands, Southern Channel Island, and along the mainland) that are most likely separated by deepwater channels (Gaida 1997). It has also been suggested that populations on the Pacific side of Baja California are distinct from that of the Gulf of California (Ebert 2003). Currently, support for these possibly divergent lineages has not been provided and the existence of distinct genetic subpopulations from throughout the eastern Pacific distribution of the species has not been assessed. Because of its rather limited geographical range and evidence of only limited exchange among regional stocks within this range, resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially fished in California beginning in the late 1970s. In 1977 landings totalled 0.15 metric tones (mt), and during the expansion phase of the commercial fishery for this species, landings rose dramatically to 117 mt in 1981, and to 277 mt in 1984. Landings peaked and began to decline from 426 mt in 1987 to 112 mt in 1990. While declines were observed around this time, these declines were not strictly a reflection of population declines, as a minimum size limit was proposed in 1987 and became law in 1989 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). In 1991, a 50% decline in effort occurred in response to bans on gill and trammel nets in California. This also had a dramatic effect on the landings, which dropped to 8.62 mt in 1995 and 8.16 mt in 1997, but then increased to 15 and 24 mt in 1997 and 1999, respectively. At the same time that landings were dropping in California, a Mexican gillnet fishery began targeting Pacific Angel Shark in 1997, with estimated landings of close to 163 mt in 1999 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). More recently, landings in California have stabilized at around 6.81 to 4.04 mt from 2005 to 2014 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000-2014).<br/><br/>Little is known about the effect of fisheries on the population of the Pacific Angel Shark in Mexico, but landings in some areas have declined and researchers have detected changes in size composition. Fisher interviews conducted along the coast of Baja California also suggest that catches have declined over time (Sergio Ramirez, pers. comm., 2 December 2016). Logbook data from the demersal trawl fleet in San Felipe, Baja California report catches of 663 to 6,375 kg from 2009-2013. Data on landed weight of the Pacific Angel Shark from Baja California reported to Bahia de Los Angeles are available over twelve years (2003-2015; CONAPESCA). These data suggest that landings have declined steadily from a peak of 83,778 kg in 2012 to 16,173 kg in 2015, representing a decline in landings of &gt;99% over three generations (2003-2057) if fishing continues at the same rate (CONAPESCA). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to detect, but effort is estimated to be relatively stable. Species-specific landings data are also available for Sonora state, but no trends in landings are yet clear (CONAPESCA).<br/><br/>A survey of landings of artisanal fishers targeting elasmobranchs was conducted in Sonora, Mexico (Gulf of California) from 1998-1999. Pacific Angel Shark constituted 1.3% of the total chondrichthyan landings, increasing to 3.3% in winter, which was considered ""a notable contribution"" by the authors (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Surveys were also conducted on the Gulf of California side of the Baja peninsular and found Pacific Angel Shark to constitute 11.6% of the total chondrichthyan landings (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Along the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula, an artisanal fishing community survey conducted between 2006 and 2008, determined that this species made up 1.86% of the total elasmobranch landings (Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011). In a survey focusing on the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, this species was found to make up 5.6% of the elasmobranch catch (a catch-per-unit-effort of 1.82 individuals per vessel per trip; Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Angel Shark occurs off the coast of North America from Alaska to the tip of Baja California, Mexico (including the Gulf of California), and&#160;is particularly abundant in central and southern California (United States) waters, especially off the coast of Santa Barbara (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, 1990; Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992, 2001) and off El Barril, Baja California (Castro 2005).&#160;It was previously reported that the&#160;South Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina armata</em>) was a possible synonym of this species, but&#160;this has largely been confirmed to be a separate species (Stelbrink&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Further evidence to support that Pacific Angel Shark does not occur in Chile was provided in a recent checklist for elasmobranchs in Chilean waters, where South Pacific Angel Shark but not Pacific Angel Shark was reported to occur (Bustamante <em>et al</em>. 2014).",This species is valued for its meat.,Marine,"The northeast Pacific population of the Pacific Angel Shark appears to have stabilized, at least in the waters of California.&#160;A ban on gillnet fisheries that targeted the California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) was voted into law by Californians in 1990&#160;(Proposition 132). Through this ban, the fishery is indirectly regulated (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1992, Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992). Additionally, a minimum retention size limit became law in 1989, which decreased the juvenile catch and overall harvest on exploited stocks.&#160;Drift gillnet fisheries are also prohibited off the coast of Washington state.<br/><br/>Further north, along the United States west coast (Washington, Oregon and California), ground fisheries are managed by a federal Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Although this species is not a focal species of the plan, and no species-specific data on the Pacific Angel Shark will be collected, other&#160;chondrichthyans&#160;are being managed under this program.<br/><br/>In Mexico, some fisheries are required to record species-specific data under the category of ""angelito"" (Pacific Angel Shark) in logbooks.

Their bathymetric distribution is shallower at higher latitudes (Dean 1906, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although their movements are not understood in detail, they do seem to display vertical and alongshore migrations within inlets protected from the open coast (Mathews 1975, Quinn <em>et al</em>. 1980, Andrews and Quinn 2012). Populations appear to segregate by sex and size (Mathews 1975, Quinn <em>et al</em>. 1980, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012), with dense aggregations of juveniles and egg cases observed around offshore banks near the shelf break (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>This species is oviparous with peak reproductive period from late spring to fall (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Egg cases are laid in pairs at a rate of approximately once per 17-19 days and extrapolating this over the 6-8 month reproductive season provides an estimated annual fecundity of approximately 20-29 eggs/year (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009a). The incubation period within the egg case is about 12 months, with newborns emerging at about 14 cm total length (TL) (Didier and Rosenberger 2002). Size at maturity for the population on the U.S. west coast is 19 cm snout-vent length (SVL) for females and 15-16 cm SVL for males. Maximum sizes for the population on the U.S. west coast are 63 cm TL for females and 50 cm TL for males. Both size at maturity and maximum size increase with latitude, and historical estimates of maximum size of the species were much greater than reported here (97 cm TL; Miller and Lea 1972). It seems unlikely that the species can be reliably aged (Johnson and Horton 1972, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Indeed no robust estimates of generation length are available for any <em>Hydrolagus</em> spp.","<p>There is no directed fishery for Spotted Ratfish. This species is reported a bycatch in groundfish bottom trawl gear, and discard mortality as bycatch may impact this species. Although reported landings are minimal, it is likely that the number of ratfish discarded at sea is quite large, given their abundance and vulnerability to trawl gear.<br/></p>","<p>Fishery-independent data from the northeast Pacific indicates Spotted Ratfish comprises a large proportion of the vertebrate biomass in the demersal community of the shelf and upper slope (Keller <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fishery-independent catch per unit effort (CPUE) data were collected from Washington, Oregon and California by the Alaska Fisheries Science Centre (AFSC) triennial trawl surveys from 1977 to 2004, and the Northwest Fisheries Science Centre (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish surveys from 2003-2006. From 1977 to 1995 CPUE was stable, and from 1995 to 2006 CPUE increased (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increases in Spotted Ratfish populations were particularly pronounced from 1998 onwards along the northern region of the US west coast shelf and upper slope, and increases were not observed in the southern shelf and upper slope, perhaps because of climate (a strong El NiÃ±o cycle) and differences in fishing pressure (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). <br/></p>",Increasing,"<p>                   </p><p>Spotted Ratfish is widespread along the western coast of North America from southern Alaska (Wilimovsky 1954) to Baja and the Gulf of California (Ebert 2003), being most abundant in the inshore waters of British Columbia, Canada and Puget Sound, Washington, USA (Palsson 2002, Palsson <em>et al</em>. 2004), along with the coastal waters off northern and southern California, USA (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012).

In California and the Gulf of Alaska, big skates reach about 250 cm TL and live to about 15 years, whereas in British Columbia they can grow up to 290 TL cm and live to 26 years. It is important to note that age estimates are based on an unvalidated method and geographic differences in size or age may reflect differences in sampling or ageing criteria. Age and size at maturity also differs between regions. In the Gulf of Alaska, females big skates reach 50% maturity at 150 cm TL (10 years) and at 120 cm TL (7 years) for males (Gburski <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2008). In British Columbia, females reach 50% maturity at 90 cm TL (8 years) and at 72 cm TL (6 years) for males (McFarlane and King 2006). The Big Skate is oviparous and deposits egg cases on the sea floor that have embryos that develop in 6 to 20 months, depending on water temperature (Hoff 2007). Fecundity estimates are difficult to obtain because the Big Skate is one of only two skates to have more than one embryo per egg case. Aquarium observations have shown that the most common number of embryos per egg case is two (Chiquillo<em> et al</em>. 2014), but the range is from 1 to 7 (DeLacy and Chapman 1935, Hitz 1964). The number of egg cases that can be produced per female each year is uncertain, but observations in aquaria indicate that females can deposit over 350 egg cases per year (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2008). This indicates that big skates may be one of the most fecund elasmobranchs.

From such coastal rivers this species is known to ascend to spawn, and when at sea, this species ranges from the surface to depths of 100m. This species is also known from Newfoundland, the St. Lawrence River and Nova Scotia, southward to central Florida. This species has been historically targeted in commercial fisheries that has been known to result in dramatic declines in population. There is concern over habitat quality and the effect that riverine, damns and estuarine impediment have on spawning success of this species. In recognition of the species declines across its range, the at-sea fishery for this species was closed, and subsequent landings from the ocean are only from the bycatch fishery. In addition,&#160;<em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is presently managed under Amendment Three of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Shad Fishery Management Plan, only allowing for catch and release via hook and line only, for states without an approved sustainable fishing plan. The purpose of this sustainable fishing plan for Massachusetts is to allow continuation of fishing, while planning for population restoration within rivers where populations are low and others where information is limited.Given that this species is so widely distributed and has shown some recovery and improvements in population abundance in parts of its range thanks to conservation efforts, this species is assessed as Least Concern.","<em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is a pelagic, coastal, migratory, and anadromous species, that utilizes riverine habitats for spawning purposes. Individuals reach sexual maturity at approximately 4-5 years (Whitehead 1985). Larvae spend their initial 3 to 4 months in riverine-nursery areas during the summer and migrate out to sea by autumn. Juveniles form schools at 20-30 mm TL and gradually move downstream (Jones, et al., 1978). Premigratory juveniles are habitat generalists, whereas earlier life stages and spawning adults are more selective (Ross et al. 1993).&#160;<br/><br/>Adults occur in marine waters except during the breeding season, spending the majority of their life at sea, returning to freshwater streams to breed (Morrow, 1980). Non-spawning adults are found in schools near the surface of continental shelf waters in spring, summer and autumn, also found in brackish waters (Hildebrand, 1964).Adults feed primarily on plankton and copepods (Whitehead 1985).&#160;<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>&#160;grows to a maximum standard length of 60 cm (average length of 50 cm) (Whitehead 1985).<br/><br/>Spawning occurs in various habitats such as runs in rivers, as far as 480 km upstream, but this however is now commonly obstructed by dams. This species first spawns at 4-5 years, feeding mainly on plankton and copepods and mysids, occasionally on small fishes, with feeding ceasing during upstream spawning migration and resumes during the downstream, post-spawning migration (Scott and Crossman, 1998).","Historical and more recent declines in abundance of <em>Alosa sapidissima</em>, throughout its range, have been attributed to over-fishing, pollution, and habitat loss from the construction of multiple dams and other riverine impediments (Haas-Castro 2006, ASMFC 2007).&#160;There have been multiple 'fish lifts' constructed at numerous damns now present within rivers occupied by <em>Alosa sapidissima</em>, but some are closed due to high water levels, contradicting the aid to this species (Sheppard and Chase, 2012) and many are not efficient for upstream passage (Sprankle, 2005).","Little population information is available for this species, however in recent years, declines have occurred throughout its range.&#160;American shad landings between the years 1990-2010, display an annual rate of decline of -4.506, monitored by the NMFS Fisheries Statistic and Economic Division, Northeast Regional Office (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). Similar monitoring is required for the previous ten years to provide accurate information on the species current status. In some rivers, restoration efforts led to increases in population abundance, from the low levels observed in 2007 within Pawcatuck and Connecticut Rivers, Rhode Island, the Potomoc River, Virginia, and the Santee River, South Carolina (ASMFC 2007, 2009). Despite this,&#160;<em>Alosa sapidissima</em> populations along the Atlantic Coast of North America are near historic lows despite the management actions designed to rebuild stocks (Dutterer, <em>et al</em>., 2016).",Unknown,"<p><em>Alosa sapidissima</em>'s native range includes the western Atlantic coast from Sand Hill River, Labrador to the St. Johns River, Florida. It is from such coastal rivers that this species is known to ascend to spawn (Page and Burr 1991), and when at sea, this species ranges from the surface to 100 m deep (Whitehead 1985).

Once commercially caught in rivers and estuaries during spawning migration (Scott and Crossman, 1998).

However, studies have identified a risk to genetic viability of populations when using such approaches.<br/><em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is presently managed under Amendment Three of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Shad Fishery Management Plan, only allowing for catch and release via hook and line only, for states without an approved sustainable fishing plan (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). The purpose of this sustainable fishing plan for Massachusetts is to allow continuation of fishing, while planning for population restoration within rivers where populations are low and others where information is limited (Sheppard and Chase, 2012).<br/><br/>It is advised that future restoration efforts proceed by providing access to historical spawning grounds, either through dam removal or through providing effective fish passage, followed by natural recolonization of reclaimed habitat (Hasselman and Limburg 2012). The construction of fish elevators and ladders around dams have also been implemented to help recover the spawning pathways for this species, otherwise blocked or isolated by dams (Brown and St Pierre 2001). However, an example of the low level of upstream passage efficiency is at of the Pawtucket Dam in Lowell. Between 1989 and 2009 it was found on average only 29% of fish that pass through the Essex Dam fish lift will ascend the lift at the Pawtucket Dam (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). Sprankle (2005) assessed passage efficiency at the Lowell Dam and found 66% of the <em>Alosa sapidissima</em> at the Essex Dam arrived at the pool downstream of the Lowell Dam, and 55% entered the dam tailrace, but only 4% entering the tailrace passed the Lowell Dam fish lift. No ripe shad have been caught below the Essex Dam during electrofishing monitoring, indicating that no spawning habitat occurs below the dam and all fish were seeking to move upstream (Sprankle, 2005; Sheppard and Chase 2012).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

In its natural range, this species shows a considerable variation in its habitat. It is found chiefly in the overgrown edges of rivers, hilly areas close to cultivation and flat land which is under cultivation. In Azerbaijan, egg-laying occurs in April and May. The nest is a shallow depression in the ground, which is lined with plant material from the vicinity of the nest, or unlined. Clutches are nine to fourteen eggs. In its natural range, the species feeds on plant matter such as fruits, seeds, leaves, buds and a small amount of animal matter, for example insects. Where it is introduced it is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a diverse range of food, preferring large, energy rich items such as cultivated grains, mast and fruits. Mass migrations may occur in its native range but in its introduced range it is sedentary (McGowan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).",In its introduced range in Europe it is very common and wild populations are often augmented by large numbers of captive bred birds for shooting.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on the breeding grounds in early-June (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996) where it may breed in small, loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) or dispersed in single pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998) (especially in the high Arctic where the habitat is unsuitable for large groups) (Kear 2005a). There is a high degree of synchrony in egg laying and hatching (Johnsgard 1978), with the adults moulting c.10 days after the young hatch (mid-July to mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996)) during which they become flightless for c.21-30 days (Johnsgard 1978, Scott and Rose 1996). Most individuals moult near the breeding grounds (Scott and Rose 1996) although immatures, unsuccessful breeders (Johnsgard 1978) and some more southerly breeding groups (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984) may undertake pre-moult migrations (Johnsgard 1978) and form large moulting concentrations well-away from nesting areas (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984). After the post-breeding moult flocks leave the breeding grounds in early-September with some arriving in wintering areas as early as mid-September, others making stopovers on route and arriving later (Madge and Burn 1988). It leaves its wintering quarters again from mid-March to mid-April (Madge and Burn 1988). During the non-breeding season the species remains gregarious, gathering in groups of only a few to several thousands of individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998), although it is rarely found in very large flocks (Kear 2005a). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in coastal Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in or close to wet coastal meadows with abundant grassy vegetation (Kear 2005a) and on tundra-covered flats with tidal streams (only just above the high tide line) (Johnsgard 1978). In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) in tundra lakes and rivers, especially if nesting Sabine's Gulls <em>Xema sabini</em> (Kear 2005a), Snowy Owls <em>Bubo scandiaca</em> (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Kear 2005a), Peregrine Falcons <em>Falco peregrinus</em> (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984) or large raptors are present to deter predators (Kear 2005a). High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005a). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005a), tidal mudlflats (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a), sandy shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), coastal saltmarshes (Kear 2005a) (especially in the spring) (Scott and Rose 1996) and shallow muddy bays (Kear 2005a). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996) and winter cereal fields (Scott and Rose 1996), but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet </strong>The species is mainly herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although it may take animal matter (e.g. fish eggs, worms, snails and amphipods) (Johnsgard 1978). <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding habitat the diet of the species consists of mosses, lichens, aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), sedges, tundra grass <em>Dupontia</em> spp., arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp. and saltmarsh grass <em>Puccinellia</em> spp. (Alaska) (Kear 2005a), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine microscopic and macroscopic algae (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. seaweeds, <em>Ulva</em> spp. (Kear 2005a)) and other aquatic plants linked with saline or brackish waters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in the intertidal zone (e.g. especially eelgrass <em>Zostera</em> spp. (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a), as well as <em>Ruppia maritima</em>, <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>, <em>Salicornia </em>spp., and arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp.) (Kear 2005a). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow depression (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Although the species often nests close to water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline (Snow and Perrins 1998), high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (Kear 2005a) (some nearly up to 10 km inland) (Snow and Perrins 1998) often near boulders where the snow clears first (Kear 2005a). <strong>Management information </strong>An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on dry, improved grasslands that had high abundances of the grass <em>Lolium perenn</em>e, were between 5 and 6 ha in area, and were at a distance of up to 1.5 km inland or 4-5 km along the coast from coastal roosting sites (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was found to show a preference for grasslands with short, dense swards c.5 cm in height, a characteristic that can be gained through summer management plans involving either mechanical cutting, livestock (sheep or cattle) grazing regimes, or cutting and then grazing (although over longer periods of time the selective grazing of sheep rather than cattle, and frequent rather than infrequent cutting may be more likely to enhance tillering and produce the short, dense sward favoured by this species) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogen in the autumn at a rate of 50 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 21 % compared with unfertilised areas (Vickery and Gill 1999), and fertilising at a rate of 75 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 9-29 % and to remove any preference the geese showed for short sward heights (between 5 and 11 cm) (Vickery and Gill 1999). In other fertilising experiments grazing intensity of the species was found to increase linearly with increasing levels of fertiliser (from 0 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> to 150 kg N ha<sup>1</sup>), although responses in grazing intensity at fertiliser levels lower than 50 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> were found to be short-lived (c.2 months after fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999).","This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005a) and is susceptible to disturbance from vehicles in the UK (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002) (although it is relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to other species) (Vickery and Gill 1999, Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers, as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in food supplies following the return of a disease of the eelgrass <em>Zostera marina</em> (a staple food) (Scott and Rose 1996).&#160;It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse.&#160;It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995).&#160;The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox <em>Vulpes</em> <em>lagopus</em> predation (Madsen <em>et al</em>. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).&#160;Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The global   population is estimated to number &gt; c.560,000-650,000&#160;individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 1,500-1,800 pairs, which equates to 3,000-3,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), travelling in stages via several stop-over sites between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). The species breeds from late-May or early-June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), with moulting non-breeders and failed breeders gathering on areas of open water separate from the major breeding congregations (Kear 2005a). After breeding the species gathers in small flocks (less than 30 individuals) (Scott and Rose 1996) to undergo a post-breeding moult period (Madge and Burn 1988) near the breeding grounds where it becomes flightless for c.25 days (Scott and Rose 1996). After this moulting period flocks gather to migrate south to winter quarters, leaving the breeding areas from late-August through September and arriving late in the autumn (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious (Madge and Burn 1988) (large flocks of up to 30,000 individuals are recorded in Europe) although it is more commonly observed in small loose groups due to the patchiness of its favoured habitat (Kear 2005a). The species usually forages within 20 km of rooting sites (Kear 2005a), although the optimum distance for foraging areas may be less than this (less than 4 km in Scotland, UK) (Vickery and Gill 1999). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in open (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), low-lying, shrubby tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998) on the coast and inland (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), in close proximity to marshes, lakes, pools, rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998), and willow- and shrub-lined ponds and streams (Johnsgard 1978). It requires dry slopes, banks, mounds, hummocks or patches of sand or clay for nesting sites, especially those commanding good views of the surrounding area (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding </em>The species winters in open country on steppe and agricultural land (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. improved grassland, stubble fields (Madge and Burn 1988) and wet meadows (Johnsgard 1978)), or in brackish (Kear 2005a) and freshwater marshy habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (such as upland bogs (Madge and Burn 1988), peatlands (Scott and Rose 1996) and floodlands (Kear 2005a)). It may also roost on tidal marshes, in sheltered bays or in estuaries and frequents inland lakes and reservoirs in North America (Kear 2005a). <strong>Diet </strong>The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of the roots, leaves, stems, seeds and fruits of terrestrial plants such as herbs, grasses and sedges (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), as well as agricultural grain (e.g. corn, oats (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), wheat, rice and barley (Johnsgard 1978)), potatoes and sprouting cereals (especially in the winter) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) amongst vegetation such as grass or dwarf scrub heath, often on raised hummocks or slopes to reduce the risk of flooding and provide a vantage point of the surrounding area (Kear 2005a). <strong>Management information</strong> An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on grasslands managed with a livestock (cattle) grazing regime, with a sward height of 13-20 cm, at a distance of less than 9 km away from roosting sites (the optimum distance was 4 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogen in the autumn (mid-October) at a rate of 125 kg N ha<sup>1</sup> was also found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 42 % compared with unfertilised areas (Vickery and Gill 1999).<strong></strong>","The species is threatened by intense hunting pressure (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) resulting in mortality  (Kear 2005a, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006) and disturbance at staging (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006). It is also susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon <em>et al</em>. 2004). Populations in Greenland are threatened by human disturbance at moulting sites from tourists in cruise liners (once displaced from a site birds are unlikely to find unoccupied replacement sites) (Glahder and Walsh 2006), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the vius (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climatic changes are likely to cause range contractions in this species's already highly restricted breeding range (Kear 2005a), and are already causing other species (e.g. Canada Geese <em>Branta canadensis</em>) to move northward, increasing competition for resources (Kear 2005a, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2006). Oil exploration in the tundra habitat poses a threat to the species's breeding (Kear 2005a) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006) by increasing the possibility of oil spills and chronic oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006), by direct habitat destruction (influencing breeding site selection and reducing reproductive success) (Kear 2005a) and through human disturbance (Glahder and Walsh 2006). Wetland habitat degradation due to drainage, peat-extraction and changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) is also a problem in areas of Russia (Grishanov 2006). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is sustainably hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al</em>. 2006).","The global population is estimated at&#160;3,100,000-3,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 259,000-310,000 pairs, which equates to 518,000-620,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex I, II and III.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is strongly migratory in the north of its range (Kear 2005b) although breeding populations in temperate regions are largely sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Males leave the breeding grounds in early-July (one month before the females and young), migrating to key waters to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks, after which they continue to the wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration occurs from March to April (Scott and Rose 1996), and although the timing of the breeding season varies geographically the species generally nests late in the year (e.g. May-July) (Kear 2005b). It breeds in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is usually observed in small parties outside of the breeding season, with large concentrations sometimes forming on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the moulting period (Kear 2005b)  (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits highly productive (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) and eutrophic (Snow and Perrins 1998) freshwater marsh or lake habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) in open lowland grassland (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988), showing a preference for sheltered, shallow, standing or slow-flowing waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) with abundant emergent vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005b) and grass-covered islands providing cover for nesting (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005b). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Rarely (e.g. in the winter) (Madge and Burn 1988) the species occurs along sheltered coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) at coastal marshes (North America) (Kear 2005b), estuaries (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), deltas or lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), its diet consisting of the seeds, leaves, roots and stems of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (submerged and emergent) as well as grasses and stoneworts <em>Chara</em> spp. (Kear 2005b), occasionally also taking cereal grains on land (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition, the species may take a small amount of animal matter during the winter (Africa), such as insects, molluscs, annelids, amphibians, amphibian spawn and small fish (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a well-hidden (Johnsgard 1978) hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) in grass and leaves positioned on the ground in thick vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as nettles <em>Urtica</em> spp. (Madge and Burn 1988), grass tussocks, thick bushes, rushes or tall grass (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species shows a preference for dense, dry herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978) and often nests far from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). It may nest in dense concentrations on islands (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) (neighbouring nests as close as 5 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998) although it is not a colonial species (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). <strong>Management information</strong> The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).  <p></p>","The species is threatened by pollution (Kear 2005b) and disturbance from recreational use of freshwater wetlands (Kear 2005b, Pease <em>et al.</em> 2005). It also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mondain-Monval <em>et al.</em> 2002) and nest predation by American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> (Europe) (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Melville and Shortridge 2006). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted throughout most of its range (Kear 2005b) both for recreation (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006, Shortridge <em>et al.</em> 2006) and commercial uses (Balmaki and Barati 2006), but is rarely taken in large numbers except where it is particularly abundant (Kear 2005b).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory and travels over land on a broad front utilising few staging areas on route (in autumn no known concentrated staging occurs) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from May to August (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) either in well-dispersed (Johnsgard 1981) solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) or in loose groups depending on the topography of the land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The autumn migration occurs from July onwards (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) with the return passage to the breeding grounds occurring chiefly between March and May (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) (non-breeders may also remain on the wintering grounds all year round) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). When not breeding the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), flying in small parties (Johnsgard 1981) or larger flocks on migration (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998)and roosting communally at night in mangrove trees or in shallow water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on dry scrub heathland (Snow and Perrins 1998), moss and lichen tundra with stunted bushes (Johnsgard 1981), sedge meadows (Johnsgard 1981), wet moorland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and mossy hummock bogs (Johnsgard 1981, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) in open areas, river valleys (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), along the shores of tundra lakes (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), in birch forest near the Arctic treeline (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), burned areas of forest (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) and open montane forest (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) in the boreal, subarctic and subalpine zones (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It generally avoids extremes of cold and wet, steep slopes, bare rock and gravel expanses or tall dense vegetation (e.g. dense forest) (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> On passage in the autumn and spring the species frequents wetlands, tidal flats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), short-sward wet and dry grasslands (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), farmland (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) and heathland with <em>Empetrum</em> spp., generally occupying coastal habitats in the winter such as muddy, rocky or sandy beaches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), coral shores (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), exposed reefs, tidal mudflats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), sandflats (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), mangrove swamps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996),<strong> </strong>tidal marshes (Johnsgard 1981) and lagoons (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Diet</strong> When inland on migration and during the breeding season its diet consists of adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera, Orthoptera and cranefly larvae), spiders, millipedes, earthworms, snails, slugs, seeds, leaves and berries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. of ericaceous plants) (Johnsgard 1981). On the coast during the winter the species takes crustaceans (e.g. crabs), molluscs, large polychaete worms and occasionally fish, reptiles or young birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) often positioned on hummocks or in short heather or grass (Johnsgard 1981, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) in dry exposed locations (Johnsgard 1981, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) sometimes far from water (Johnsgard 1981, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). When the breeding habitat (e.g. tundra or heathland) is flat and open the species nests in solitary pairs, but where irregular features such as hummocks and tall vegetation patches give more visual isolation the species may nest in loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> A study in the Shetland Islands, UK found that when trying to enhance the grazing quality of heathlands by re-seeding (e.g. with high quality grass-seed mixtures) it is better to apply lime, grass-seed and inorganic fertiliser directly to the surface of the ground rather than ploughing and harrowing the ground first, as the latter maintains more natural vegetation hummocks and heather used by the species for nesting (Grant 1992).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species is fully migratory and travels on a broad front across Europe (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It breeds from May to August (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986) with males gathering in suitable lekking areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984) and females nesting solitarily or in semi-colonial groups (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species departs the breeding grounds between late-June and August, returning from the wintering grounds from March to mid-May (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species migrates in large flocks of hundreds or thousands of individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) and forms huge dense groups on its wintering grounds (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986). The species inhabits tundra habitats from the coast to the Arctic treeline (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) during the breeding season, requiring adjacent foraging, lekking and nesting areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It shows a preference for dry mounds and slopes with low willow <em>Salix </em>spp. and dwarf birch <em>Betula </em>spp. as lekking areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), and dry patches of tall sedge as nesting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable foraging habitats include littoral belts, deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal saltmarshes (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981) and extensive lowland freshwater wetlands such as small shallow lakes with marginal vegetation (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981, Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), grassy hummocky marshes (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981, Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), and damp swampy grasslands (Johnsgard <em>et al.</em> 1981, Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), with shallow pools or ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). During the non-breeding season the species occupies the muddy margins of brackish, saline and alkaline lakes, ponds, pools, rivers, marshes and food-plains (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), as well as freshly mown or grazed short-sward grasslands (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) and wheat- or rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), usually roosting at night in the shallow waters of lake shores (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species rarely utilises intertidal habitats (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986) but may frequent tidal mudflats and lagoons in India (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). During the breeding season the species's diet consists almost entirely of adult and larval terrestrial and aquatic insects such as Coleoptera and Diptera (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). On passage and during the winter the species takes insects (e.g. caddisflies, water-bugs, mayflies and grasshoppers), small crustaceans, spiders, small molluscs, annelid worms, frogs, small fish and the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The nest is a shallow scrape (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) concealed in marsh vegetation or meadow grass (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) on damp ground (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981) usually more than 100 m away from the nearest lek site (Johnsgard <em>et al</em>. 1981). The species nests solitarily or semi-colonially, neighbouring nests occasionally only a few metres apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Management information Intensive grazing of grassland (&gt; 1 cow per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi <em>et al</em>. 2005).","The species is threatened by petroleum pollution (Grishanov 2006), wetland and flood-plain drainage ( del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Grishanov 2006) (for irrigation and water management) (Grishanov 2006), peat-extraction, and land abandonment and changing land management practices that lead to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species may also suffer future population declines and range contractions as a result of global climate change (ZÃ¶ckler 2002), and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet <em>et al</em>. 2007), avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974,  Hubalek <em>et al.</em> 2005) and avian malaria (Mendes <em>et al</em>. 2005), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The European population is estimated at 265,000-1,650,000 calling or lekking males, which equates to 531,000-3,310,000 mature individuals or 797,000-4,970,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It breeds from June to mid-July in solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), departing the breeding grounds between mid-July and early-September (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986). The species usually occurs in small flocks on migration (Johnsgard 1981) although it may aggregate into larger flocks at stopover sites (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986), and in winter it forages in small to very large flocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in the high Arctic on barren, stony tundra with well-drained ridges (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), gentle slopes or level alluvial plains supporting scattered vegetation of willow <em>Salix</em> spp., <em>Dryas</em> spp. and saxifrage <em>Saxifraga</em> spp. usually less than 200 m above sea-level (Johnsgard 1981). <em>Non-breeding</em> On passage the species may occur on inland freshwater or saline lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) but it is largely coastal during the winter, inhabiting open sandy beaches exposed to the sea, the outer reaches of estuaries, rocky and muddy shores, mudflats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and coral reefs (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> When breeding the species takes insects (especially adult and larval Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) as well as spiders and crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).

On passage to its wintering grounds the majority of the species travels overland on a broad front, although there is also an important route down the west coast of Europe (Smit and Piersma 1989, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Females begin to moving south in early-June, the males following during July, and juveniles migrating from August to September (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The movements of this species are characterised by long flights between staging areas (such as the Wadden Sea, Dutch delta region, southern Hungary, south-east Greece, central Turkey, the Black and Caspian Seas, central Kazakhstan, Lake Baikal, Chang Lake (Ussuriland), central Yakutia, Sakhalin, Japan and Korea) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), those birds wintering in Sahel and northern savanna zones (e.g. Mali, Nigeria and Chad (Smit and Piersma 1989)) also cross the Sahara (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Arrival in Africa begins in August and peaks in October (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986), the species being present throughout the tropics mainly between October and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and returning to arctic breeding grounds between late-April and mid-May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Few birds remain in the tropics during the breeding season, but non-breeders may spend the summer just south of the breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds in dispersed pairs and is often seen singly, although it is also common in parties of up to 20 and exceptionally over 100 (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Adults typically moult in large flocks (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) in staging areas in their arctic breeding range before moving to wintering grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). This species is both a diurnal and nocturnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season this species inhabits lowland and upland (but not montane) regions, in wooded and open tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, swampy pine or birch forest near the arctic tree-line, and also more open areas such as heathland and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> During migration and on its wintering grounds (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) this species frequents a variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands such as sewage farms, irrigated rice fields, brackish lagoons, salt-marshes, salt-pans, sheltered muddy coastal shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), marshes and marshy lake edges (Johnsgard 1981, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), small reservoirs, pools and flooded grasslands (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting chiefly of aquatic insects and their larvae (especially swimming beetles and hemipterans), terrestrial flying insects (such as craneflies), small crustaceans, molluscs, polycheate worms, and small fish and amphibians up to 6-7 cm long (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest of this species is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) positioned in grass tussocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), on sphagnum moss (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), or in fairly dry areas of forest amongst low vegetation such as dwarf willows (Johnsgard 1981). Nest sites are often selected near dead trees or other suitable look-out perches (Johnsgard 1981).<strong></strong>","This species is threatened by habitat loss in its wintering range and on migration: wetland sites in Ghana are being degraded through coastal erosion and developments involving drainage and land reclamation (Ntiamboa-Baidu 1991);  and in China and South Korea important migrational staging areas around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.110,000-270,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 20,500-54,000 pairs, which equates to 41,000-108,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;National population estimates include: &lt;   c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in   China; c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering   individuals in Taiwan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000   individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Stable,<p></p>,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive and Annex II of the Bern Convention.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Intensive grazing of grassland (&gt;1 cow per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi <em>et al</em>. 2005).,Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It arrives on the breeding grounds from early-May to late-June (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (depending on local conditions [Kear 2005a])<strong><sup></sup></strong> where it breeds well-dispersed (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> in single pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, occasionally nesting semi-colonially in optimum habitats (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a)<strong></strong>. After breeding the species undergoes a flightless moulting period lasting for c.30 days between late-June and early-September, gathering in flocks on open waters (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Family groups leave the breeding grounds from early-September to late-October (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and arrive on the wintering grounds from mid-October onwards (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During this autumn migration some groups may remain at stop-over sites until moved on by cold weather (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The return northward migration occurs from early-March, with the species travelling in small parties that disperse on arrival in the Arctic (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season, often gathering into large flocks of hundreds or thousands of individuals on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species forages by day (where undisturbed [del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992])<strong><sup></sup></strong> and roosts at night on open water (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds near shallow pools, lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and broad slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with emergent littoral vegetation and pondweeds (e.g. <em>Potamogeton</em> spp.) connected to coastal delta areas (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> in open, moist, low-lying sedge-grass or moss-lichen (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It rarely nests in shrub tundra, and generally avoids forested areas (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> On migration the species frequents shallow ponds (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, lowland and upland lakes (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, riverine marshes, shallow saline lagoons (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and sheltered coastal bays and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter it inhabits brackish and freshwater marshes (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, rivers, lakes, ponds (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and shallow tidal estuarine areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with adjacent grasslands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, flooded pastures (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> or agricultural arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005a)<strong></strong> below 100 m (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, its diet consisting of the seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, rhizomes and stems of aquatic plants (e.g. <em>Potamogeton</em>, <em>Zostera</em> and <em>Glyceria</em> spp.), grasses (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, sedges, reeds (<em>Phragmites</em> and <em>Typha</em> spp. [Kear 2005a])<strong><sup></sup></strong> and herbaceous tundra vegetation (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter the species complements its diet with agricultural grain and vegetables (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (e.g. potatoes [del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992]<strong><sup></sup></strong> and sugar beet [Kear 2005a]<strong><sup></sup></strong>), and may also take estuarine invertebrates such as molluscs, amphipods (e.g. <em>Corophium</em> spp.) and polycheate worms on tidal mudflats prior to migration (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a large mound of plant matter positioned on elevated ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> such as a ridge or hummock, often at some distance from feeding pools<strong><sup> </sup></strong>to reduce to the risk of flooding (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species may re-use a nest from the previous year or build a new one, and although it is not colonial, many pairs may nest close together in optimum habitats (e.g. 5-16 pairs per 10 km<sup>2</sup> [Kear 2005a])<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Management information </strong>An experiment carried out in the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, California found that in wetland habitats where clay hardpans underlie wetland sediments tilling (plowing) the soil may be an effective means of reducing lead shot availability to waterfowl (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2001)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Plowing was found to reduce the amount of shot available to depths of 20-30 cm (below the foraging zone of the species [Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2001])<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","The species is threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitats due to drainage (Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (e.g. for agriculture [Grishanov 2006])<strong><sup></sup></strong>, petroleum pollution, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth), the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and eutrophication (Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;The north-west European population is thought to be particularly sensitive to land-use change as well as climate change due to its narrow breeding distribution across the Russian high Arctic and its high dependency on a small number of stop-over sites during spring and autumn migration (Nagy <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;In the Far East declines have been recorded owing to decreases in submerged vegetation, possibly as a result of eutrophication and changes in hydrology brought about by dam construction (Cong <em>et al</em>. 2011, Carboneras and Kirwan 2016).&#160;Its Arctic breeding habitat is also threatened by oil and gas exploration (Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species is threatened by mortality from oil pollution (oil spills) in moulting and pre-migrational staging areas, from collisions with powerlines, and from lead poisoning as a result of lead shot (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and fishing weight ingestion during migration and on wintering grounds (Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species suffers from poaching in north-west Europe, is hunted for sport in North America (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and is hunted considerably for subsistence throughout its range (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

In addition, measures should be implemented to prevent the negative impacts of infrastructure and industrial development by avoiding key sites, or by mitigating any potential negative impacts in the absence of alternative locations. Where necessary, develop and implement emergency plans by companies involved in the exploitation and transportation of petrochemicals on the flyway to reduce mortality in case of accidents. Monitoring and research of population changes and demographic parameters should continue and dead bird surveillance should be expanded to cover the entire flyway of the species.

It generally prefers to nest in large open expanses of relatively low vegetation, and is late maturing, long-lived and has a low reproductive output. In winter it favours intertidal habitats but will feed in adjacent pastures (Leeman and Colwell 2005).
</P>","Sea-level rise may reduce the amount of available intertidal wintering habitat in future (Colwell and Mathis 2001). The loss and conversion of large areas of short grass prairie into agricultural land within its range has presumably had a major impact upon the species and is likely to the most important threat at present. Long-billed Curlew are facing increasing threats in the grasslands and prairies of North America, both on their breeding and wintering grounds. In addition, Long-billed Curlew range contractions on the eastern edge of their range continue to cause concerns.","Continental populations were thought to be declining by 2% per year between 1980 and 1996 (equivalent to 16% in ten years) (AOU 1998, Hill 1998); however data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey indicate that these figures were incorrect and in fact annual declines at a rate of 0.6% between 1980 and 2006 are more realistic (Morrison et al. 2006). This equates to a decline of just 5.8% over a ten year period. However, it appears that there are considerably more Long-billed Curlews than previously thought, with a likely global population in the order of 50,000-123,000, based on recent assessments, expert opinion and statistically based surveys (Wetlands International 2006).",Decreasing,"This species was once an abundant breeder over most of the prairie regions of the USA and Canada.

Over-exploitation in the  non-breeding range (in particular in Suriname) may be the principal  driver of declines, with eastern-breeding populations also potentially declining due to reduced food supply at key staging sites and changes in arctic breeding habitat, but further information on the rate and drivers of declines is needed.","It breeds in high and low Arctic and subarctic wet sedge or heath tundra, often near pools, rivers and lakes (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). In the non-breeding season it is mainly coastal, favouring sandy beaches and intertidal mudflats, sometimes also shallow lagoons and saltmarsh (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). On migration it is also found &#160;at inland wetlands (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). Food is mainly chironomid larvae in the breeding season, along with other small invertebrates and seeds. Various small aquatic, marine and terrestrial invertebrates are taken on migration, including horseshoe crab <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Limulus polyphemus </span>eggs on spring migration in eastern USA  (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). Makes non-stop flights of up to 4,000 km on migration, with flocks of up to 350,000 gathering at key stopover sites  (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996).","Hunting of shorebirds in northern South America, which is legal in Guyana but illegal in&#160;French Guiana and&#160;Suriname, is widespread and thus a potential threat to <em>C. pusilla</em>. Shorebirds killed by hunters in Suriname are estimated to number several tens of thousands annually, involving mainly <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. pusilla </span>and<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Tringa flavipes</span>: if 20,000 <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. pusilla</span> were removed from a population of two million annually (1% decrease, net after recruitment), the decline would amount to some 26% over 30 years, independent of other mortality, suggesting hunting could be a significant factor in the observed declines (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Poaching in Suriname may have increased over the last c.20 years  owing to improvements in weaponry and transportation. Another potential  threat is the harvesting of horseshoe crabs <em>Limulus polyphemus </em>in Delaware Bay, an area  which reportedly sees the passage of c.60% of the total population of <em>C. pusilla</em>  during the spring migration. The species feeds primarily on horseshoe crab&#160;<em></em>eggs during episodes of rapid mass  accumulation, but harvest pressure from 1995-2005 dramatically reduced  egg availability  (Mizrahi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Significant changes in the intertidal profile, for unknown reasons, have taken place along the coast of the Guianas, although numbers of birds were also lower in areas with no obvious changes in mudflat area (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Use of pesticides in agricultural areas such as rice fields may affect shorebirds using those habitats directly, and drainage of pesticides into coastal areas and onto mudflats also has the potential to affect shorebirds (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Small-scale gold mining has increased considerably in the northern South American wintering range, and mercury, which is used in the extraction process and can reach the coast via the rivers, has the potential to affect shorebirds in coastal areas (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Oil exploration is underway in Suriname and Guyana, with spills representing a further potential threat. Increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes during southbound migration may be causing increased mortality during this period (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012).&#160;On the Canadian Arctic breeding grounds, the influence of grazing of Snow Geese (<em>Anser caerulescens</em>) and Ross's Goose (<em>Anser rossii</em>) on shorebird habitats is debatable but the effects last for decades (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The population was formerly estimated at 3.5 million individuals, but  this was revised downwards to 2.2 million individuals in 2006 (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, A.

It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1000km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65Â°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m.

Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter.

Predation by Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) is also a threat (Mebs and Schmidt 2006).","The global population is estimated to number approximately 3,000,000 individuals or 2,000,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013). The European population is estimated at 32,000-51,600 pairs, which equates to 64,000-103,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Europe forms approximately 15% of the global range so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 427,000-687,000 mature individuals. The North American population is estimated at approximately 1,300,000 individuals or 867,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013).

The timing of breeding varies geographically but often occurs during the rains in the tropics (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is highly territorial and often forages and nests singly (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), occasionally also nesting in loosely spaced single-species groups of 5-15 pairs, or even in larger breeding aggregations of several hundred (300-500) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) pairs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species shows a preference for forested water margins (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) such as mangrove-lined shores and estuaries, or dense woody vegetation fringing ponds, rivers, lakes and streams (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other suitable habitats include river swamps, canals, artificial ponds, salt-flats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mudflats, tidal zones, exposed coral reefs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), reedbeds, grassy marshland, pastures, rice-fields and other flooded cultivation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet varies considerably over its range (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) but usually consists predominantly of fish (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) as well as amphibians (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. frogs) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), insects (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) (e.g. water beetles, grasshoppers and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, leeches, crustaceans (e.g. crabs and prawns), molluscs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), earthworms, polychaete worms, birds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), small reptiles and mice (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small, shallow structure of twigs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed well hidden amongst the branches of trees or bushes (especially mangroves <em>Rhizophora</em> spp. and <em>Avicennia</em> spp., or <em>Allocasuarina</em> spp., <em>Myoporum</em> spp., <em>Callistemon</em> spp., <em>Hibiscus</em> spp., <em>Casuarina</em> spp., <em>Syzygium</em> spp.<em> </em>and <em>Inga </em>spp.) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) 0.3-10 m above the surface of water or above the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The species is threatened by human disturbance, pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and habitat destruction (e.g. the loss of mangroves) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is taken for food in some areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).",The global   population has not been estimated following recent taxonomic changes.,Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Afrotropical|Antarctic|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is not known from any other regions in the world, and was not  encountered during 45 years of general forest disease surveys in western  Canada. There are only 10 known current sites, but the albeit infrequent collections have been reliably identified from two continents and from&#160;<em>Alnus</em>&#160;hosts with a broad geographical range, which elevates the estimated number of sites where&#160;<em>B. bartholomaei</em>&#160;might occur to 100. Further targeted surveys within the range of its&#160;<em>Alnus</em>&#160;host will be required to better estimate the status and trend of&#160;<em>B. bartholomaei. </em>Therefore, the present assessment is Data Deficient (DD).","<em>Biscogniauxia bartholomaei</em>&#160;is a saprotrophic fungus causing a white rot of alder wood, on branches and trunks of  host trees, where the black stromata (reproductive structures) develop under the bark and force  the bark off in large sheets.&#160; In coastal regions of the Pacific  Northwest, it has been found on large, over-mature trees with broken  tops. <em>Biscogniauxia</em> species are known to be saprotrophic, i.e. causing  wood decay and persisting to produce fruiting bodies for years after  tree death on fallen logs, but they also opportunistic parasites,  causing bark loss and cankers on standing live trees stressed by  environmental factors such as drought stress or top breakage from  weather events (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2003). Therefore the fungus might be less  prevalent in healthy stands, and more prevalent on the boundaries of  natural distribution of the tree hosts where they are more likely to be  physiologically stressed, for example in sites prone to drought or at  high altitudes or coastal decadent stands stressed by soil erosion and  winter storms.","Threats in the coastal  Pacific Northwest sites include reduction of habitat due to  urbanization. As <em>Alnus</em> is the preferred host for <em>Bisconiauxia bartholomaei</em>, there  is potential risk of habitat  destruction by the oomycete <em>Phytophthora  alni</em> Brasier and S.A.Kirk , a virulent pathogen of alder, if it were  introduced. <em>Alnus rubra</em> is highly susceptible to this pathogen (Downing  <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There are less than  20 collections known of <em>Biscogniauxia bartholomaei</em> worldwide, from approximately 10  different sites. In the United States it is known from the type  collection made in 1909 at Rolling Bay WA, and another 1909 collection  at nearby Bainbridge Island, WA, Kitsap County, all on <em>Alnus rubra</em>.  There are two other collections from Washington State, one in Sequim in  1901 on <em>Populus trichocarpa</em> (an unusual host, which should be  confirmed), and another in Snohomish County on <em>A. rubra</em>. It is also  known from a coastal site in Oregon, Cape Perpetua, Lincoln Co. in 2015,  on <em>A. rubra</em>.<br/><br/>The first Canadian record of <em>B. bartholomaei</em> was collected on  Southern Vancouver Island in 1995 on <em>A. rubra</em>. Since then it has been  observed in three nearby decadent <em>A. rubra</em> stands located in the  southern tip of Vancouver Island, BC, but nowhere else in Canada. A separate host association is reported from two locations in Northern  Idaho, collected in 1922, and 2004 on <em>A. tenuifolia</em>, at higher  altitudes. It has also been collected from the Russian Far East on the Kamtchatka peninsula, on <em>A. kamschatia</em>.<br/>As the clustered fruitings on exposed wood are often large and showy and  especially visible in winter and early spring before leaves develop on  surrounding vegetation, it seems unlikely that the species is overlooked  when found. In the Pacific Northwest in particular, there are no other  pyrenomycete species with the same combination of morphology and habit  where it occurs on mature decadent <em>A. rubra</em> in coastal stands.<br/><br/>Taking into account that there are ten known sites worldwide, we  estimate that 30 trees per site will bear fruiting bodies, because the  tree groves bearing the fungus usually have several infected trunks due  to close proximity. Adding a factor of 10 genotypes per tree due to high  genetic diversity in stromata as demonstrated in other <em>Biscogniauxia</em>  species (Henriques <em>et al.</em> 2014), the disjunct distribution, the host  range of<em> Alnus </em>species contiguous with known sites, and allowing the total  number of sites to be 10 times higher to allow for those yet  undiscovered, we estimate the total number of mature individuals of <em>B.  bartholomaei</em> to be 30,000.<br/><br/>Information on the full extent of the population is too sparse to appropriately evaluate the status and trend.",Unknown,"<em>Biscogniauxia bartholomaei</em> is currently known from the Pacific Northwest and the Russian Far  East.

Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014).

97667070,190422,Mola mola,Vulnerable,A4bd,2015,2011-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widely distributed. It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic and is captured in large numbers as bycatch in fisheries using long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls in a number of widely distributed fisheries. In some fisheries, the catch of <em>Mola mola</em> exceeds that of the target species. Preliminary calculations from three of these fisheries (two South African longline fisheries, and the USA Southwest Region drift net fishery), indicate 300, 26,000 and 340,000 individual <em>M. mola</em> per fishery are made each year and it is likely that other fisheries using these same methods are taking large, but unreported, bycatch of <em>M. mola</em> throughout the majority of its range. In some areas, substantial declines (up to 100%) have been documented, likely driven by the high bycatch. Based on these declines and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over three generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future. Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable under A4bd. Future monitoring and research on its basic biological variables such as age at maturity, generation time, etc. is recommended.<br/></p>","<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is an oceanodromous, pelagic-oceanic species that occurs in subtropical waters between depths of 30 and 480 m, but is usually between 30 and 70 m (Powell 2001, Riede 2004, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Adults are found on slopes adjacent to deep water where they come in for shelter and to seek out cleaner fishes (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). It&#160;is an active swimmer capable of highly directional movements and horizontal movements independent of the current (Cartamil and Lowe 2004); it&#160;uses its anal and dorsal fins as a pair of wings (Pope&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).&#160;It feeds on fishes, molluscs, zooplankton, jellyfish, crustaceans, and brittle stars (Clemens and Wilby 1961, Scott and Scott 1988, Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). Cartamil and Lowe (2004) observed a diel pattern in depth&#160;utilization, with fish residing in the warmer mixed layer above or within the thermocline at night and repeatedly diving beneath the thermocline into cooler water during the day (Californian waters, July-September 2001). Hays<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>(2009) also noted that although individual sunfish showed a range of preferred depth that altered over time, they were still moving up and down the water column and regularly returning to close to the surface. Although its exact function has yet to be resolved, Cartamil and Lowe (2004) proposed that periodic returns to the surface in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> may imply some form of behavioural thermo-regulation i.e. prolonged time in cold waters necessitates time spent at the surface to re-warm. This may explain the frequent observations of ocean sunfish observed 'basking' or swimming on their sides at the surface during the day (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). Conversely, Sims <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009a) argued that extensive vertical movements may simply reflect a crepuscular searching strategy when prey are descending or ascending, with sunfish attempting to locate maximum prey abundances at this time. It has been also been suggested more generally that large amplitude dives or ascents of large pelagic fish and other vertebrates during prey tracking may represent prey searching behaviour (Shepard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006)&#160;characterized&#160;by extensive movements to new locations (Sims<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008).&#160;It exhibits sexual dimorphism; females are larger than males (Pope<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<br/>Maximum total length is 333 cm (Claro 1994); maximum published weight is 2.3 t (Roach 2003); all animals larger than 250 cm TL are female (Nakatsubo 2008).&#160;Very few studies have been conducted on the reproductive biology of ocean sunfish (Pope <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). In Japan,the spawning period&#160;is estimated between August and October and the same study also identified asynchronous egg development, suggesting it is a multiple spawner (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007).&#160;The lifespan or reproductive age of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> under natural conditions is unknown, although captive animals have been maintained for more than 8 years (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). A growth curve derived from repeated measurements of captive specimens estimated an individual with a total length of 3 m would be about 20 years old (Nakatsubo 2008). Recent work used growth band pairs in vertebrae to age the closely related sharptail mola <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. lanceolatus</span> caught in the eastern Taiwan fishery (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The age estimates ranged between &gt;2 and &gt;23 years for females and &gt;1 and &gt;16 years for males (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). &#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mola mola</span> is famously the most fecund of all vertebrates (Carwardine 1995) with a 137 cm female containing an estimated 300 million eggs (Schmidt 1921). By necessity, these eggs are very small (mean diameter 0.13 cm; Gudger 1936) and so <em>M. mola</em> growth is staggering. For the 0.25 cm larva to grow to a 3 m adult requires an increase in mass of 60 million times (Gudger 1936). A more atypical captive growth rates have been found to be between 0.02 and 0.49 kg/day in weight (M. Howard and T.

Using the estimator for generation length of 1/adult mortality + age at first reproduction results in a generation length of 8-10 years, and thus a time window for calculating population declines of 24-30 years.","Ocean sunfish populations may be vulnerable to fishing activity because of the high levels of bycatch observed in many fisheries, including&#160;long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls&#160;(Silvani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Fulling <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Petersen and McDonell 2007).&#160;In South Africa, mid-water trawl fishery of the Cape horse mackerel&#160; (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Trachurus trachurus capensis</span>)  caught predominantly large individuals and observed a significant  decline in ocean sunfish catch rates between 2000 to 2003, with other  bycatch species remaining comparatively stable (Petersen and McDonell  2007). Bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest  ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch; far outnumbering the target  species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic.&#160;<em>Mola mola</em>  is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in a number of widely  distributed fisheries.","This species is a common resident of the offshore waters of the northwestern Atlantic during the spring and summer months, with an estimated summer abundance of 18,000 (Kenney 1996 in Potter <em>et al.</em> 2011). Large aggregations of small (&lt;1 m TL)&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> have been observed in coastal waters (Pope <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;SyvÃ¤ranta <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Irish and Celtic Seas, a total of 68&#160;were spotted from 2003-2005, or an overall density of 0.98 sunfish per 100 kmÂ²<sup></sup> (Houghton<em> et al.</em> 2006).&#160;According to reports from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Region, between 1990 and 1998, 26.1% of the drift net catch consisted of <em>M. mola</em>. This translates to a catch of more than 26,000 individuals (Rand Rasmussen, NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center, pers. comm. in Dewar <em>et al. </em>2010). Off the coast of South Africa, <em>M. mola</em>&#160;bycatch rates from the tuna and swordfish longline fishery are estimated at 340,000 sunfish annually (Petersen 2005, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Although estimates of population size are generally lacking, there is evidence of local population declines over short time scales.&#160;In Namibia,&#160;<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>showed a peak of catch landings in 2006 (40 metric tonnes), then decreased with only 7 metric tonnes in 2007 (FAO 2014); while CPUE was not available, this represents a decline of 82.5%. Landings have recently been reported from Argentina and are likely to increase (FAO 2014). In Ireland, there was been a decline of about 100% (13 to 0 metric tonnes) in 2 years (2000-2002). There was also a decline in Portugal from 12 metric tonnes in 1999 to about 0 in 2009 (FAO 2014).<br/><br/>Based on localized declines that exceed 80% and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over 3 generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is circumglobally distributed throughout warm and temperate zones of all oceans. In the eastern Pacific it is known from Canada (British Columbia), south to Peru and Chile (Chirichigno 1974,&#160;Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1983). In the Indo-Pacific it is known throughout the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, from Russia and Japan to Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands (Muus 1964, Smith 1965, Ayling and Cox 1982, Sims and Southall 2002, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Houghton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Konow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Todd and Grove 2010).&#160;It is considered a waif in the Persian Gulf.&#160;In the eastern Atlantic it is known from Scandinavia to South Africa (and occasionally in the western Baltic, North,&#160;and Mediterranean Seas). In the western Atlantic it is known from Canada (Newfoundland) south to Argentina including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea (Robins and Ray 1986,&#160;Figueiredo and Menezes 2000).&#160;Its depth range is 0-400 m (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).","<em>Mola mola</em> is not a commercially important fish (Fulling&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Silvani&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999), although there is some market for it in Japan (Sagara and Ozawa 2002, Watanabe and Sato 2008) and Taiwan (20.8-49.4 tonnes per annum, Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic. This species<em>&#160;</em>is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in long line, drift gillnet and midwater trawl&#160;fisheries. For example, the South African longline fishery for tuna and swordfish was estimated to have annually caught between 0.08 and 0.29 sunfish for every 1,000 hooks set (1.6-2.7 million hooks per year) in the 4 years between 2000 and 2003 (Petersen 2005). Furthermore,&#160;it&#160;was by far the most common bycatch species in the Cape horse mackerel (<em>Trachurus trachurus capensis</em>) midwater trawl fishery in the same region (Petersen and McDonell 2007), representing 51% of the total bycatch between 2002 and 2005 (Petersen and McDonell 2007). Similarly,&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;comprised between 70 and 93% of the total fish catch in Spanish drift gillnet fisheries within the Mediterranean between 1992 and 1994 (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999); bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch, far outnumbering the target species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). A crude calculation using values from a recent study of the Moroccan fleet (Tudela&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) suggests an annual bycatch of 36,450 ocean sunfish. Whilst the majority of&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;are returned to the water alive (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999), they often show varying levels of trauma (Cartamil and Lowe 2004) and post-catch survival data are lacking.&#160;<br/>There is little or no fishing effort likely to affect this species in the Gulf of Mexico (H.

98845541,98471199,Clupea pallasii,Data Deficient,,2019,2019-02-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a marine, pelagic-neritic schooling species that is widely distributed throughout the southern Arctic and northern Pacific oceans. Archaeologically, subpopulations were abundant throughout its range despite natural fluctuations; however, more recently (1900âs) this species has exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines, possibly caused by heavy industrial exploitation during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century combined with natural causes like food availability and climatic changes. Overall, currently available (~ 2000 â present) global population information for this species is extremely variable. Some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these estimates are spatially and temporally asynchronous. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other neighboring localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the trends of available data within and between regions (including temporal differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population.</p>  <p>The prominent threat to this species is likely a changing climate which can impact food availability for each of several life history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults), spawning distribution and recruitment within local stocks. Additionally, climatic changes can also impact the distribution of major predators (e.g., birds, pinnipeds and other fishes) which can have widespread ecological and fishery effects. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that disease can significantly affect recruitment especially as a consequence of anthropogenic impacts, though more research is needed. In general, this species is also exploited to a varying degree throughout a large portion of its global range. It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific; it is one of the few important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory and has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s. However, little current information on the status of this species in this region is available. In the eastern Pacific, this species is targeted at varying intensities in the purse seine and gill net fisheries for food, bait and sac roe exploitation. Throughout its range, it likely also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes. Given the commercial importance of this species, fisheries management regulations have been implemented within its range, such as yearly fishery closures and stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points. In some areas, (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska) herring have responded to management measures. However, it has not proven to respond well to management and conservation measures in other localities where it has experienced major declines in abundance, even after periods of long-term fisheries closures in some cases (e.g., Cherry Point, Washington, Yellow Sea, Hokkaido-Sakhalin). This may further suggest that natural changes are possibly preventing the recovery of this species in these areas. </p>  <p>In general, the status of this species within the southernmost portions of its range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change, potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters. It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to the concern of the possible depletion of local stocks. More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution.</p>  <p>In light of the major commercial importance of this species, marked declines in some places and increases in others, and major data gaps in large regions of its range where it is known to be exploited (e.g., current/recent status in Japan and Russia), assessing the overall status of this species globally as per the IUCN Red List Criteria is not possible, and therefore <em>Clupea pallasii</em> is assessed as Data Deficient. If and when information becomes available where it currently is not, this species should be immediately be reassessed. Furthermore, due to the variations in life history characteristics, exploitation level and biomass trends, sub-global assessments for this species are urgently needed. </p>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a pelagic-neritic schooling species that mainly occupies the deeper waters of coastal shelf regions to about 300 â 400 metres at maximum. Herring move inshore to breed in high-energy, shallow intertidal and subtidal habitats from about November to July (Whitehead 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). Spawning takes place once a year (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a) in many localities throughout its global range. Pacific herring are late winter and spring spawners (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a) with peak spawning events occurring later in the spring at progressively higher latitudes (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). For example, in the eastern Pacific, spawning takes place from November to March in California, February to April in British Columbia, and from March to June off south and north Alaska, respectively (Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Age at maturity varies geographically from 1 â 4 years of age (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During mass spawning events, females deposit adhesive eggs directly on the bottom, on vegetative substrata such as seagrasses and seaweeds, rocky intertidal areas or man-made structures (e.g., pier pilings, rip rap: Blaxter 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em><em>2001a, </em>2009, Shirafuji <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160; After spawning, individuals generally migrate back to foraging grounds in deeper water (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Similar to age at maturity and spawning time, there is latitudinal variability in other biological factors including, maximum size, longevity and migration patterns. For example, compared to herring within the eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska herring reach a smaller maximum size overall, have a shorter maximum longevity, more frequent recruitment events (every four years compared to every ten years in the eastern Bering Sea) and do not undergo large migrations (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, schools consist of individuals of similar size/age such that juveniles do not mix with larger juveniles or adults (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This species is known to a maximum standard length of 33 cm (Whitehead 1985), though there are records of this species with a total length of 46 cm (Coad and Reist 2004). Maximum longevity varies from 7 â 15 years (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Adult herring are known to exhibit extensive diel vertical migrations where they are deeper in the water column by day and shallower during the night (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Herring diets vary but they mainly consume zooplankton; larvae consume copepod eggs, nauplii and young stages of other organisms, juveniles mainly consume copepods and adults predominately feed on copepods and euphausiids (Wailes 1936, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Long-term cyclic changes in size-at-age of Alaskan herring have been correlated to zooplankton abundance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), though direct causes are not known (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is possible that subpopulations elsewhere (e.g., Hokkaido â Sakhalin, Yellow Sea) are impacted by food availability and climatic variation as well, though more research is needed. </p><em> </em>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii</em>&#160;is heavily fished throughout a large portion of its global range and has shown considerable population fluctuations with dramatically reduced abundance levels in parts of its range (see summaries in: Ware 1991, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010, FAO 2016, WDFW 2018<em>a</em>). Archaeological evidence indicates that this species exhibited natural fluctuations; however, over the last century, some subpopulations have exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines (McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is possible that drastic declines stemmed from natural causes; however, excessive industrial harvesting is suggested to be a likely reason for differences in ancient and modern herring abundance (McKechnie and Smith 2013). In more recent years, other factors such as food availability and environmental forcing, rather than heavy fishing pressure, likely play a larger role in the overall abundance throughout its range (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Ward <em>et al. </em>2017, 2019), as most fisheries appear to be regulated and respond to management. For example, in British Columbia, precautionary harvest policies have been in place since 1986 (i.e., stocks are managed using a 20% harvest rate and a commercial fishery threshold of 25% of the estimated unfished spawning biomass, 0.25B<sub>0</sub>: Cleary <em>et al. </em>2010). Since policies have been in place, most major stocks within British Columbia experienced declines in biomass until 2010 (Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010). Similarly, all five major British Columbian stocks experienced declines in weight-at-age from the mid-1980âs to 2010, with a levelling off and/or increase in the most recent five years available (2012 â 2017: DFO 2018). Additionally, herring in British Columbia previously displayed a long-term decline in size-at-age, suggesting a possible reduction or limitation of the food supply or other resources that may have prevented recovery (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010); however, this declining trend has reversed in the most recent years (2010 â present: Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). </p>  <p>It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to concerns about possible depletion of local stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2009). There is also evidence to suggest that disease significantly affects recruitment of this species (Marty <em>et al</em>. 2011); however, more research is needed to determine the overall severity of this potential threat.</p>","<p></p><p><strong><u>OVERALL POPULATION TRENDS</u></strong></p>  <p><em>Clupea pallasii</em> is a cold-water clupeid distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. Overall, available population information for this species is extremely variable. For example, some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. This species, similar to other clupeids, is known to have large episodic recruitments (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the past (e.g., 1977) there has been broad temporal synchrony throughout many years with the arrival of strong cohorts in British Columbia and Alaska (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001b), though this is not consistent with current trends. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these SSB estimates are usually asynchronous with respect to neighboring localities. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by greater than 85 % over the time series and up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by 35 â 1000 % over the time series and up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the temporal trends of available data within and between regions (including differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population. For consistency, all data reported in short tons (e.g., U.S. data) were converted and are expressed in metric tonnes. </p>  <p>In general, the conservation status of herring within the southernmost portion of its global range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern due to climate forcing. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change (Perry <em>et al. </em>2005, Hillebrand 2018, USGCRP 2018), potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters.</p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHWESTERN PACIFIC</u></strong></p>  <p>Within the northwestern Pacific, this species is divided into three subsections: the northwestern North Pacific, which includes five major stocks in Russian waters; the southwestern North Pacific, which includes the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan; and the Yellow Sea (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the northwestern Pacific region, there appear to be three distinct forms of herring: (1) a migratory âmarineâ herring, which is relatively long-lived and which undergoes considerable migrations; (2) a similar âcoastalâ form which consists of a number of smaller groups and spends most of its life close to shore with little or no migrations; and (3) a unique âlagoonâ form (sometimes referred to as âlakeâ herring) whose life history is connected with low-salinity lagoons or embayments (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, the five major Russian stocks, along with the Hokkaido-Sakhalin stock constitute the major âmarineâ forms of the western Pacific, which comprise the largest total biomass and support large commercial fisheries in the northwest Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Coastal and âlagoonâ forms may be unique to the western Pacific; similar forms have not been described from the eastern Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Specific information regarding the three subsections in the northwestern Pacific is listed below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Northwestern North Pacific (Russia):</u></strong><em> </em>Five major stocks exist within this region: Korf-Karagin stock in the northwestern Bering Sea; Gizhiga-Kamchatka stock along the Kamchatka Peninsula; Okhotsk stock in the Sea of Okhotsk; Dekastri stock in the Strait of Tartary; and Peter the Great Bay stock in the Sea of Japan (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Additionally, Russian scientists recognize roughly 20 smaller groups of âcoastalâ and âlagoonâ herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Commercial fisheries for Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay stocks were established first (~1920s); substantial commercial fisheries began to target other stocks in later years (Korf-Karagin in 1939, and Okhotsk and Gizhiga-Kamchatka in the mid â to late â 1940s: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catch records are characterized by substantial variation in annual catch overall, reflecting fluctuations in the availability of herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The three northernmost stocks (Okhotsk, Gizhiga-Kamchatka and Korf-Karagin) previously supported very large catches which increased rapidly in the late 1950s and exceeded ~500,000 tonnes in the 1960s (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This peak was followed by a rapid decline in all five âmarineâ stocks where a decline in catch rates and assessed biomass led to a prohibition of commercial fishing (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). A period of very low abundance persisted until the late 1990s where there was evidence of a modest recovery of the Okhotsk and Korf-Karagin stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). As of the early 2000s, the southernmost Russian stocks (Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay) remained in a state of severe depression (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Information regarding the more recent status (i.e., 2001 â present) is not available for these five major stocks. </p>  <p><strong><u>Southwestern North Pacific (Hokkaido-Sakhalin):</u></strong><em> </em>One major stock is recognized within this subsection of the northwestern Pacific waters, which includes the waters off the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan. It is referred to as Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (sometimes also referred to as Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring). Previously, this stock was the most abundant among all western Pacific herring stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During the first half of the 1900s, Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring were very widely distributed and supported an industrial fishery in the northern part of the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk (along the shores of eastern Sakhalin to the Island of Iona, and along the Kuril Islands to the Island of Paramushir), and the Pacific Ocean (along the southern Kuril Islands: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catches have been recorded by national and provincial authorities in Japan and Russia since 1887, with a historical peak of 973,000 tonnes in 1897 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Since the peak in 1897, catches show fluctuations with an overall declining annual trend and fishing grounds moved north along the western coast of Hokkaido; spawning herring have disappeared from the Hokkaido coast altogether (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the most recent years available (~ 1960s â 2000), the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring has been at the lowest level of abundance for the entire history of its commercial exploitation; it has declined from an average of 67.2 billion fish in the late 1800s â 1950 to about 5.8 billion fish in the 1950s, and has further declined to an average of 1.6 billion fish between 1961 and 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Small fisheries have continued since the collapse of this stock with annual catches less than 50,000 tonnes on average (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The cause of collapse is not certain; oceanographic conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature) have changed, which may limit recruitment in the region. Additionally, the major decline coincided with a period of increased effort, efficiency and industrialization of the fishery (e.g., introduction of acoustic sounders, spotter planes and trawl nets) where immature and young fish were caught in high numbers, which likely further limited recruitment. As of 2000, there were no indications of change in the extremely depressed status of the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a); information regarding the more recent status (2001 â present) is not available for this stock.</p>  <p><strong><u>Yellow Sea:</u></strong> Herring in the Yellow Sea may be completely isolated from others within the northwestern Pacific (Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008). In the Yellow Sea region, this species undergoes rapid and extreme fluctuations in abundance. Changes in biomass may be caused by herring seasonally moving in an out of the Yellow Sea (D. Hay, pers. com. January 2019); long-term changes may be correlated with a 36-year cycle of dryness/wetness in eastern China (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is commercially important in the Yellow Sea and has a very long exploitation history in the surrounding countries. In the last century (1900 â 2000) the commercial fishery experienced three major peaks (1900, 1938 and 1972) followed by periods of little to no catch (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This stock experienced a historical maximum abundance in 1972 following a strong recruitment event in 1970; biomass was estimated to be 200,000 tonnes in 1972 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). However, since 1982, this species has substantially declined in the Yellow Sea due to a series of very weak year classes (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The catch decreased to below 1,000 tonnes in 1989 â 1990 and no fishing took place until at least 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Currently, it is listed as a species of special concern in the Yellow Sea as abundance has decreased significantly and it requires protection and enhancement programs (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 1988 as cited in Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>  <p>Overall, nearly all herring in the northwestern Pacific have undergone long-term periods of extreme fluctuations in the past; during periods of active fishing most stocks have declined to a state of depression or even collapse. However, based on the most recent estimates available (prior to 2001), most stocks have recovered to the point where abundance equaled or exceeded historical estimates. Pacific herring within the Hokkaido-Sakhalin and Yellow Sea regions are of concern as its abundance has remained severely depleted in the most recent years available. </p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC </u></strong></p>  <p>In contrast to the northwestern Pacific, where this species is found in a few, large subpopulations, in the northeastern Pacific, it consists of a large number of (&gt;20) relatively small subpopulations (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a), many of which have long-term time series data available that continue to the present. For the purposes of this assessment, the delineation of this species within the northeastern Pacific encompasses its geographic distribution throughout western U.S. and Canadian territories, from Alaska, south to California. Available species-specific information regarding the northeastern Pacific is described below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Alaska (U.S.)</u></strong><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Western Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Arctic â Yukon â Kuskokwim (AYK) region: </u></em>Projected 2018 biomass for the Arctic â Yukon â Kuskokwim region (Norton Sound south to Security Cove) was estimated to be 54,782 tonnes (ADF&amp;G 2018a). The largest abundance of herring in the AYK region is in the Norton Sound district (Menard <em>et al. </em>2017); projected biomass for this district in 2018 is 30,775 tonnes, which makes up over half of the total projected biomass for the AYK region (57,782 tonnes: ADF&amp;G 2018a). Total allowable harvest is 10,683 tonnes. Commercial fishing may occur in this region in 2018 given that all preseason projected biomass thresholds are expected to be exceeded (ADF&amp;G 2018a). However, based on limited fishing effort from previous years and a lack of market interest in the region since 2006, only a small portion of the total allowable catch is anticipated to be taken in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). A commercial fishery is not anticipated in the Kuskokwim district due to a lack of market interest; a small commercial bait fishery is anticipated out of Norton Sound in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). Catch monitoring will be implemented if commercial fishing occurs (ADF&amp;G 2018a). </p>  <p><em><u>Togiak District (Bristol Bay)</u></em><u>: </u>The preseason biomass forecast for 2018 in the Togiak district was projected to be 124,062 tonnes, which is considered healthy and stable (ADF&amp;G 2018b). Herring in the Togiak district are commercially harvested for sac roe, spawn on kelp, as well as for food and bait; the herring fishery in this district is the largest in Alaska (ADF&amp;G 2018b). The commercial sac roe fishery was opened in this region in 2018; however, no commercial harvest of spawn on kelp took place in 2017 due to a lack of commercial interest (ADF&amp;G 2018b). </p>  <p>Overall, the recent abundance in the Bering Sea (early 2000s), based mainly on SSB estimated from the Togiak district, is much lower (~140,000 tonnes) than the highest estimate of nearly 500,000 tonnes in 1985 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The abundance of the many smaller stocks in the same region showed no clear trends in time (Hay <em>et al</em>. 2001a). </p>  <p><strong><em>Central Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Information from Central Alaska is available from the Prince William Sound district. A Bayesian assessment of this species within the Prince William Sound was conducted using biomass data up to 2013; findings indicate that abundance remains at low levels in recent years (Muradian <em>et al. </em>2017). Aerial survey acoustic estimates of SSB from 1973 â 2016 agree with the Bayesian assessment; SSB, although stable, has remained at very low levels since the mid- to late-1990s following a drastic decline in the late 1980s (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). All commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p><strong><em>Southeast Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available for most stocks within Southeast Alaska, including Sitka Sound, Lynn Canal, Seymour Canal, Craig, Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay- Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Revilla Channel (including Kah Shakes- Cat Island and Annette Island Reserve), Seymour Canal, West Behm Canal and Tenakee Inlet (Hebert 2017). Stocks in southeastern Alaska have asynchronous SSB trends; some stocks have declined in the most recent 15 years available (e.g., Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay â Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Seymour Canal, Tenakee Inlet), while others have remained stable (e.g., Sitka Sound, Revilla Channel, West Behm Canal), or increased (e.g., Lynn Canal, Craig). Overall, combined SSB estimates show a fluctuating pattern in the most recent 15 years (2003 â 2017) with a declining trend since the most recent peak (2011); however, SSB appears to have stabilized at a low level in the most recent 4 â 5 years available (Hebert 2017). The total combined SSB estimates in 2017 for all of Southeast Alaska as calculated from spawn deposition estimates was 62,457 tonnes and is at a similar level to that of the late 1990s (Hebert 2017). Overall, the relatively stable pattern between 2016 and 2017 SSB estimates can be largely attributed to changes in the two largest stocks, which typically account for about 80 % of the total SSB in southeastern Alaska â Sitka Sound showed a decline of approximately 41 % between 2016 and 2017, while Craig showed an increase in 2017 roughly double that of 2016 (Hebert 2017). Despite overall stability in the most recent 4 â 5 years, there was a decline between 2016 and 2017 (~ 26 %). However, several areas (i.e., Lynn Canal, West Behm Canal, Revilla Channel, Tenakee Inlet, Ernest Sound, Hoonah Sound and Hobart Bay-Port Houghton) were not surveyed in 2017 and this may have led to some of the discrepancy between the two years (Hebert 2017). Combined spawn deposition estimates for 2017 suggest that SSB in southeast Alaska is at a moderate level relative to the period 1980 â 2016 (Hebert 2017). The combined SSB estimate of 62,457 tonnes is about 67 % of the mean SSB (1980 â 2016); however, this is considered to be an underestimate because several areas were not surveyed in 2017 (Hebert 2017). </p>  <p><strong><u>British Columbia (Canada)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species in British Columbian waters is divided into five major stock areas that are assessed regularly: Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), Central Coast (CC), Strait of Georgia (SOG), and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI); and two minor stock areas: Haida Gwaii Area 2W and WCVI Area 27 (DFO 2018). Each major stock area is made up of numerous smaller spawning groups (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates are available for the five major stocks until 2017 and estimates have been projected to forecast the 2018 SSB (DFO 2018). In general, all five major stocks show a decline in weight-at-age from the mid-1980s to 2010, with a leveling off or slight increase in the most recent five years available (2012 â 2017: DFO 2018, Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). Stocks within the Haida Gwaii and West of Vancouver Island regions, however, continue to show a declining SSB trend in recent years (DFO 2018). Additionally, there is a large portion of the British Columbian coast (e.g., Johnstone Strait) where many small spawning groups exist but are not assessed regularly and no commercial fisheries occur (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). In this region, herring predominantly reach maturity at age three (DFO 2018). </p>  <p>&#160;<strong><em>Haida Gwaii:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB have remained low in the most recent years available, including 2017; two models estimate a declining trend in SSB since 2013 (DFO 2018). Additionally, since 2000, the Haida Gwaii stock has been in a low productivity, low biomass state, which indicates a negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Median estimated SSB in 2017 was 3,963 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB estimate for 2018 is similar to the 2017 level (4,367 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Prince Rupert District:</em></strong></p>  <p>This stock has been characterized by two periods of consistent and stable spawning biomass: 1996 â 2003 and 2006 â 2007 (DFO 2018). Since 2005, estimated SSB productions have been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 21,738 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB for 2018 is similar to 2017 (23,924 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Central Coast:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2012, including 2017 (DFO 2018). Since 2012, estimated SSB production for the Central Coast stock has been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 30,474 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 is similar to 2017 (32,458 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Georgia:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2010 (DFO 2018). Since 2008, estimated SSB production for the Strait of Georgia stock has been positive, indicating stock growth. The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 114,626 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (125,285 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI):</em></strong></p>  <p>In most years since 2005, including between 2016 and 2017, the WCVI stock has been in a prolonged low productivity, low biomass state, indicating negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Given a decline in estimated SSB, WCVI has been closed to fisheries since 2006, with the exception of the spawn on kelp (SOK) fishery permitted in 2011 (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 17,742 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (20,003 tonnes: DFO 2018). </p>  <p><strong><u>Washington (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species is separated into 21 small stocks within four major stock regions in inland Washington waters, including north Puget Sound, south-central Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (combined, these areas are now referred to as the âsouthern Salish Seaâ). In this region, only the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks can be genetically differentiated; the other herring stocks have not shown genetic divergence, suggesting adequate gene flow (WDFW, 2018a). </p>  <p>Spawning stock data are available for most stocks through 2018 (WDFW 2018b). Stocks can fall into one of seven categories based on the previous 4 â year mean abundance compared to long-term previous 25 â year abundance (Stick <em>et al.</em> 2014): <strong>Increasing</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance more than 20% above the 25-year mean; <strong>Healthy</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance within 20% of the 25-year mean; <strong>Declining</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 21-50% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Depressed</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 51-80% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Critical</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 81-99% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Undetected</strong> - A stock that can no longer be found in a formerly consistently utilized spawning ground for four consecutive years; <strong>Unknown</strong>- Insufficient assessment data to identify stock status with confidence. Overall, 19% of stocks were listed as Increasing or Healthy in 2016, though the percentage of stocks listed as such has steadily declined over the years available (e.g., 38% in 2000: WDFW 2018b). Currently, three stocks are listed as Increasing (i.e., Quilcene Bay, Samish/Portage Bay and Semiahmoo Bay), one as Healthy (i.e., South Hood Canal), two as Declining&#160; (i.e., Holmes Harbor, Dungeness/Sequim Bay), two as Depressed (Squaxin Pass and Skagit Bay), and ten as Critical (Wallochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Port Orchard-Port Madison, Port Susan, Port Gamble, Killisut Harbor, Discovery Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, Fildalgo Bay and Cherry Point). Three other stocks currently have Unknown status (Purdy, Elliot Bay, Northwest San Juan Islands) due to a lack of long-term data (WDFW 2018b). Excluding the genetically distinct stocks (i.e., Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass), all other Washington herring stocks combined reportedly have a Healthy standing overall (WDFW 2018b), although this is driven by the rapidly expanding Quilcene Bay stock, which currently makes up over 50% of the total estimated spawning biomass. If Quilcene Bay is excluded from the overall total, the remaining stocks are collectively considered to be Declining. Individual stocks listed as Critical (especially the genetically distinct Cherry Point stock which has declined more than 96% since the initial SSB estimate in 1973: WDFW 2018b) are of concern in Washington. </p>  <p>Overall, estimated SSB for all stocks within the Puget Sound has shown a fluctuating trend with an average just under 11,800 tonnes throughout the available time series (1973 â 2017: WDFW 2018b). Using the most recent 15-year window available (2003 â 2017), estimated SSB has declined from 12,287 tonnes in 2003 to 7,790 tonnes in 2017, which represents an approximate 37 % decline within three generations.</p>  <p>There is a limited commercial fishery for herring in Puget Sound which targets 2-3 year old fish for the sport bait market. Over the past decade this fishery has taken an average of 6% of the total estimated biomass for all stocks; no fishing is allowed north of Admiralty Inlet or south of the Tacoma Narrows to protect the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks.</p>  <p><strong><em>Puget Sound:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Northern Puget Sound (including Cherry Point): </u></em>The Northern Puget Sound region includes the Fidalgo Bay, Samish/Portage Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, NW San Juan Islands, Semiahmoo Bay and Cherry Point stocks. The Cherry Point stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is of particular concern in this region. The Cherry Point stock status has been listed as Critical since 2000 and has shown a declining trend (greater than 96 %) in SSB estimates since the beginning of the available time series in 1973 (WDFW 2018b).</p>  <p><em><u>South/Central Puget Sound (including Squaxin Pass): </u></em>The South-Central Puget Sound region includes the Purdy, Wollochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Elliot Bay, Port Orchard-Port Madison, South Hood Canal, Quilcene Bay, Port Gamble, Kilisut Harbor, Port Susan, Holmes Harbor, Skagit Bay and Squaxin Pass stocks. The Squaxin Pass stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is currently in a Depressed state (WDFW 2018b). Of particular concern are the stocks recently reported to be in a Critical condition (i.e., Quartermaster Harbor, Wollochet Bay, and Port Orchard-Port Madison).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Juan de Fuca:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>The Strait of Juan de Fuca:</u></em> includes the Kilisut Harbor, Discovery Bay and Dungeness/Sequim Bay stocks. The Discovery Bay stock has been in a Depressed or Critical state since 1996 and remains Critical in 2016. The Dungeness/Sequim Bay stock was reported to be Increasing in 2000 but has been either Declining or Critical since that time. The Kilisut Harbor stock has also declined since 2000, with no spawn detected from 2009-2012 (a Disappearance event), but spawning has returned and the stock was listed as Critical in 2016. </p>  <p><strong><u>Oregon (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>In Oregon, SSB is estimated from the number of spawning adults surveyed in the previous year (Baraff and Loughlin 2000). Biomass estimates exist from Yaquina Bay, Oregon from 1979 â 2011 with a mean of 487 +/- 501 tonnes over a 31 year time series (Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite an overall decline in SSB estimates throughout the available time series, within the most recent fifteen years available (1997 â 2011), SSB estimates have largely fluctuated but show a 2 â 3 fold increase overall. </p>  <p><strong><u>California (U.S.)</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>  <p>The four largest spawning areas in California are San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay, Humboldt Bay and Crescent City Harbor (Hay <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2001a); however, little to no information is available from Tomales Bay, Humbolt Bay, and Crescent City Harbor. </p>  <p><strong><em>San Francisco Bay: </em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available from San Francisco Bay (1979 â 2018) with an average of 44,000 tonnes (CDFW 2018). The SSB estimate in 2017 â 18 was 13,879 tonnes which represents the fourth year in a row of below average estimated SSB (CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>Commercial fishing of this species within San Francisco Bay continued during the 2017 â 18 season at a low level of effort relative to historical levels, which coincided with an estimated SSB well below the long-term average and the fourth year of low overall returns for this fishery (CDFW 2018). Low SSB estimates likely reflect sustained impacts from El NiÃ±o conditions (i.e., high sea-surface temperatures and depressed productivity in the California Current Ecosystem: CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>In the most recent 15 years available (2003-04 â 2017-18), SSB has fluctuated with an average of about 37,920 tonnes, but shows a declining trend overall. Estimated SSB in 2003-04 was 31,207 tonnes and has declined to about 13,879 tonnes in 2017-18, representing a decline of 55.5 % within 15 years (thought to represent three generation lengths for this species).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is widely distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. It occurs in the Arctic from the White Sea, east to the Ob Inlet, and the Beaufort Sea to the Amundsen Gulf off the Yukon, Northern and Nunavut Territories. In the Pacific, this species occurs in the northwest region from the Bering Sea, including the Anadyr Bay and the eastern coast of Kamchatka, south to&#160; northern Japan, and the western coast of Korea; and in the northeast region throughout the Gulf of Alaska including off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, south along the coast of Washington, Oregon and California to northern Baja, California (Tester 1937, Whitehead 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Coad and Reist 2004, Kim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). This species has been included in a checklist of fishes from Shandong, China (Cheng and Zhou 1997); however, this requires verification. This species occupies a depth range of 0 - 475 m (Coad and Reist 2004).<strong></strong></p>","<p></p><p>This species is exploited with varying intensity throughout a majority of its geographic distribution. Level of harvest ranges from heavy exploitation in industrial and commercial fisheries to areas of no exploitation such as various small subpopulations within the northeastern Pacific, including those fisheries which have closed due to a low SSB (i.e., Prince William Sound, Alaska: Russell <em>et al. </em>2017) or lack of market interest (i.e., Norton Sound, Alaska: Menard <em>et al. </em>2017). This species appears to be less important in Arctic regions, but in general, it is a highly important commercial species in both western and eastern Pacific regions (Whitehead 1985, Coad and Reist 2004, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;McKechnie and Smith 2013, McKechnie<em> et al</em>. 2014). It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific (Zeller <em>et al. </em>2018); it is one of several important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory. This species has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s but also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes (&lt;3 %: Sobolevskaya and Divovich 2015). It is also taken in commercial purse seine and gill net sac roe, spawn on kelp and other food and bait fisheries (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). It likely also contributes to bycatch throughout its range. </p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Given this species ecological and commercial importance, species-specific stock management regulations are in place in parts of its range (e.g., British Columbia, Alaska) such as yearly fishery closures, stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017, Menard <em>et al.</em> 2017). For example, in British Columbia, this species is fished with a 20% harvest rate and commercial fishery threshold (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2010). During periods of low abundance, closures are implemented in some regions. For example, no commercial removal is currently allowed from the Haida Gwaii, central coast and western coast of Vancouver Island stocks (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017). Also, all commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species geographic distribution also overlaps with many existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). More information in needed to determine how this species is impacted by food availability and climatic variation especially regarding larval and juvenile herring. <strong></strong></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
101138963,12518,Lynx canadensis,Least Concern,,2016,2014-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<strong>This is an amended version of the original assessment that was published in 2014, with some corrections to the distribution map included. </strong><br/><br/>The Canada lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) is listed as Least Concern because over most of its range it is widespread and abundant, it has been legally harvested for the international fur trade for more than 200 hundred years, and recent decades of managed harvests do not appear to have caused any significant population decline or range loss (Mowat <em>et al.</em> 2000). In the southern part of its range, lynx are less abundant and as a result are protected from harvest. In New Brunswick, lynx are listed as âEndangeredâ under the New Brunswick Species at Risk Act, in Nova Scotia as ""Endangered"" under Nova Scotia's Endangered Species Act (Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006), and in 14 contiguous United States as ""Threatened"" under the US Endangered Species Act due to inadequate protection of habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000). Although a federal recovery plan for lynx in the US has not been started, since listed as Threatened, lynx in the northeast US have been increasing (Vashon <em>et al.</em> 2012) and only one state with a resident breeding population has documented significant declines in lynx numbers (Koehler <em>et al.</em> 2008). Lynx in the contiguous US may require connectivity with northern populations for persistence (McKelvey <em>et al.</em> 2000, Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003, Squires <em>et al.</em> 2013). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) decision to designate 39,000 acres of critical habitat in portions of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Washington and Wyoming (USFWS 2009) has been challenged and remanded to the USFWS (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).","Canada Lynx are found primarily in boreal forests, and their main prey species, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>), depends largely on patches of successional growth (Buskirk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) in older multi-layered stands (Ruediger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Koehler <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Squires <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008) or younger regenerating stands following disturbance (Burdett 2008, Vashon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Walpole <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Hares make up 60-97% of the lynx diet, with an average consumption rate of one hare every 1-2 days (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The lynx-hare cycle was first observed in harvest records of the Hudsonâs Bay Company dating back to the early 1800s. Numbers of Snowshoe Hares peak approximately every ten years in the northern part of their range, and lynx numbers follow the same pattern with a short lag, typically 1-2 years. The fluctuations can be drastic, with hare abundance reaching 2,300/kmÂ² during the peaks, and crashing to 12/kmÂ² during the lows. While the populations of many prey and predator species are cyclic and roughly synchronous in the northern latitudes, the hare-lynx correlation is particularly close (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Three primary variables are suggested to drive the cycle: predation, herbivory, and food-plant availability (Krebs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Historically, lynx trapping pressure also influenced the amplitude of the cycle (Gamarra and Sole 2000). Since predator and prey communities are more diverse in the southern part of the lynx range, the importance of Snowshoe Hares in the diet of southern lynx populations has been questioned (Buskirk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). However, recent studies have shown that lynx in southern areas prey almost exclusively on Snowshoe Hare (Hanson and Moen 2008, Maletzke <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fuller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Squires and Ruggiero 2007). Ungulates do not usually figure prominently in the lynx's diet, other than as carrion, although lynx preyed on Caribou calves in Newfoundland after the hare population crashed (Bergerud 1983). Lynx home ranges average 15-50 kmÂ² and tend to be larger on the southern periphery of their geographic distribution, suggesting that these areas contain are marginal habitat. Average lynx densities range from 1-45 animals (including young) per 100 kmÂ², and fluctuate with hare abundance (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). However, in an area in Maine where dense young stands of softwood were common, lynx home ranges were averaged 25 kmÂ² for adult females and 50 kmÂ² for adult males (Vashon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008).","In most of Canada and Alaska, trapping of lynx for the fur trade is managed through regulated seasons. Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends (Golden 1999, Mowat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). In the early 1980s (1980-1984), an average of 35,669 Canada Lynx pelts were exported from the US and Canada during the cyclic high. By the late 1980s (1986-1989) the annual export of lynx averaged 7,360 pelts during the cyclic low. Exports have trended lower and fluctuated less severely since then, with annual exports from 2000-2006 averaging 15,387 pelts (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Historical information suggests that, despite minimal harvest controls for much of the last century, lynx-hare cycles have been largely stable in the northern part of their range and no permanent range decrease has been detected (Mowat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Poole 2003).<br/><br/>In eastern Canada where lynx are protected, the primary threat is believed to be from interspecific competition from the eastern coyote, which expanded its range into eastern North America in the last few decades (Parker 2001). In southern Alberta, road density and the presence of Coyotes influenced lynx occupancy (Bayne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). In the contiguous US, the primary threat to lynx is habitat loss or fragmentation. Maintaining connectivity with the abundant northern lynx population is considered essential for recovery of southern lynx populations (Ruediger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Nordstrom 2005,Walpole <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Squires <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) especially with warmer climate (Hoving <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Caroll 2005). Older multi-storied forest provide winter habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare (Koehler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Squires <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) in the western US fire frequency has increased four-fold in the western U.S. in boreal forests that supports lynx and this disturbance is expected to increase with warmer climate (Westerling <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006) . However, young dense conifer forest also provides habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare, thus natural disturbance and logging practices that foster dense understoreys of conifers can benefit lynx and hares (Burdett 2008, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, and Walpole <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Climate change increases insect-related disturbance to boreal forests (Fleming <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Logan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition from other predators whose populations have increased in recent decades may also affect lynx through direct mortality or competition (Bunnell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Bayne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, but see Kolbe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). The USFWS concluded that trapping was not responsible for lower lynx numbers at the edge of their range (USFWS 2000). Since listed as threatened, only a few lynx are captured and die in traps or snares set for other furbearers (DelGiudice <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Although lynx have been killed on logging roads with lower traffic volumes and speeds (Vashon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), roads with high traffic speed and volumes may result in more road mortalities (Moen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Although, hybridization with bobcats has been found by genetic analysis in Minnesota, Maine, and New Brunswick (Schwartz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Homyack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008), hybridization does not appear to threaten southern lynx populations (Homyack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).","The Canada Lynx is primarily found in Canada and Alaska, where it is managed and trapped for its fur. It is considered Endangered in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Cape Breton), and has been extirpated from Prince Edward Island and mainland Nova Scotia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Parker 2001, Poole 2003, Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006). In the contiguous US, lynx populations are smaller and protected from harvest. In 2000, lynx were federally listed as threatened (USFWS 2000) in 14 States. Currently, resident breeding populations of lynx are supported in four States: Maine, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. Lynx populations in Maine have increased in recent years (Vashon <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The abundance of lynx in Maine likely has contributed to the recent occurrence of lynx in New Hampshire and Vermont, including evidence of reproduction (Vashon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The only significant recent decline in lynx numbers has occurred in Washington following recent forest fires (Koehler <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Lynx remain relatively uncommon in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho and are absent in Oregon, New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan (USFWS 2000). Lynx were reintroduced unsuccessfully in northern New York state in the late 1980s (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), and more recently, successfully, in Colorado where some offspring born in Colorado have also reproduced (Devineau <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). In the northern parts of their range, lynx populations undergo dramatic fluctuations roughly every ten years. These population fluctuations follow the regular cycles of population increase and decline of their primary prey, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>). This pattern of fluctuation is evident in lynx fur trade records dating back to the early 1800s (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the southern parts of their range, lynx and hares appear to maintain a relatively stable but low density (Parker 2001). Schwartz <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2003) documented reduced genetic variation in lynx from the peripheral areas of the range.",Stable,"Canada Lynx generally occupy the boreal forest regions of North America. Its range is coincident with that of their main prey, the Snowshoe Hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>) (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Lynx occur throughout most of mainland Alaska and occupy 95% of their historic range in Canada (Parker 2001, Poole 2003). In the contiguous United States, lynx historically occurred in 24 states (McKelvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000), possibly ranging as far down the Rocky mountain chain to include a 25th, New Mexico (Frey 2006). However, there is some uncertainty about whether an occurrence or even many occurrences means the area is part of their historic range (McKelvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000). In 2000, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed lynx as Threatened in 14 States: Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Although a recovery plan has not been written, in 2005 the US Fish and Wildlife Service identified six ""core"" areas for recovery where there had been evidence of lynx reproduction within the last 20 years: northern Maine and New Hampshire, northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern Idaho, the Kettle mountain range and âWedge areaâ between the Kettle and Columbia rivers of Washington state, the northern Cascade range of Washington state, and the Greater Yellowstone area of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho (Nordstrom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005). A reintroduced population in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado was identified as a provisional core area where 218 lynx from Canada and Alaska were released between 1999 and 2006. Although there is evidence of reproduction, the long-term viability of this population has not been demonstrated (Devineau <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).",See details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Although Canada Lynx are one of five North American furbearers included on CITES Appendix II, in order to monitor the international trade of their fur, there are no quotas or suspensions currently in place. In Canada, the national and provincial governments manage harvests by region (Government of U.S. 2007), using closed seasons, quotas, limited entry and long-term trapping concessions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the US, trapping takes place only in Alaska, and harvest quotas are increased during periods of population increase and decreased during periods of cyclic decline (Government of U.S.&#160;2007).<br/><br/>The lynx population in the contiguous US was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2000, due to inadequate regulatory mechanisms to protect lynx or lynx habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000) requiring the US government to develop a recovery plan and identify critical habitat for lynx (Nordstrom 2005). In the absence of a recovery plan, activities on federal lands are guided by the lynx conservation assessment and strategy (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).<br/><br/>The US Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended various measures to trappers (e.g., avoid the use of hares or rabbits as bait) to reduce accidental taking of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Golden and Krause 2003). In addition, several States have passed trapping regulations to further reduce accidental capture of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Del Giudice <em>et al.</em> 2007, Vashon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Critical habitat designations only apply to federal lands or private lands with federally funded or permitted activities. This designation gives the federal government the authority to manage activities that affect the designated habitat. In 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a revised designation of critical habitat. The designation significantly increased a 2006 designation of 4,768 square miles within the boundaries of Voyagers National Park in Minnesota, Glacier National Park in Montana, and North Cascades National Park in Washington (USFWS 2009). In total, 39,000 square miles of critical lynx habitat was designated in 2009 as follows:<br/><br/>Maine: Approximately 9,497 square miles in portions of Aroostook, Franklin, Penobscot, Piscataquis and Somerset Counties.<br/><br/>Minnesota: Approximately 8,065 square miles in portions of Cook, Koochiching, Lake, and St. Louis Counties, and Superior National Forest.<br/><br/>Northern Rocky Mountains: Approximately 10,102 square miles in portions of Boundary County in Idaho, and Flathead, Glacier, Granite, Lake, Lewis and Clark, Lincoln, Missoula, Pondera, Powell and Teton Counties in Montana. This area includes the Flathead Indian Reservation, National Forest lands and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the Garnet Resource Area. North Cascades: Approximately 1,836 square miles in portions of Chelan and Okanogan Counties which includes BLM lands in the Spokane District. Greater Yellowstone Area: Approximately 9,500 square miles in Gallatin, Park, Sweetgrass, Stillwater, and Carbon Counties in Montana, and Park, Teton, Fremont, Sublette, and Lincoln Counties in Wyoming. The Kettle range of Washington state was not included as critical habitat due to lack of recent evidence of reproduction, and the reintroduced population of Colorado and Utah in the southern Rockies was also not included due to lack of evidence that it is self-sustaining. In September of 2013, for the 3rd time since lynx were listed as threatened, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed revising lynx critical habitat. If revised, an additional 632 square miles will be designated as critical habitat (USFWS 2013).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

They are abundant throughout their range and are increasing in distribution as humans continue to modify the landscape. The species is very versatile, especially in their ability to exploit human modified environments and there is no reason to expect that they are currently at risk of extinction.","Coyotes utilize almost all available habitats including prairie, forest, desert, mountain and tropical ecosystems. The ability of coyotes to exploit human resources allows them to occupy urban areas; their recent expansion in eastern Panama has been attributed to their using deforested areas and areas of cattle&#160;ranching (MÃ©ndez-Carvajal and Moreno 2014). Water availability may limit Coyote distribution in some desert environments.&#160;Coyotes are opportunistic, generalist predators that eat a variety of food items, typically consuming items in relation to changes in availability. Coyotes eat foods ranging from fruit and insects to large ungulates and livestock. Livestock and wild ungulates may often be represented in coyote stomachs and scats as carrion, but predation on large ungulates (native and domestic) does occur (Andelt 1987). Predation by Coyotes on neonates of native ungulates can be high during fawning (Andelt 1987). Coyotes in suburban areas are adept at exploiting human-made food resources and will readily consume dog food or other human-related items.","There are no current major threats to Coyote populations throughout their range. Local reductions are temporary and their range has been expanding. Conservation measures have not been needed to maintain viable populations. Coyotes adapt to human environs and occupy most habitats, including urban areas. Hybridization with wolves and dogs is documented, but likely occurs only at the leading edge of expanding populations, with back-crossing into the Coyote populations resulting in low levels of dog and wolf introgression spread throughout some new populations (VonHoldt <em>et al</em>. 2011; MÃµnzon <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Coyotes are abundant throughout their range and are increasing in distribution as humans continue to modify the landscape. Elimination of larger predators (wolves, coyotes, jaguars) may also have assisted their expansion. Coyote density varies geographically with food and climate, and seasonally due to mortality and changes in pack structure and food abundance. Localized control efforts have sometimes temporarily reduced population size, but they quickly rebound through migration and breeding, and Coyote populations generally are stable or increasing in most areas.&#160;<br/><br/>Coyote densities in different geographic areas and seasons vary from 0.01â0.09 coyotes/kmÂ² in the winter in the Yukon (O'Donoghue <em>et al.</em> 1997) to 0.9/kmÂ² in the fall and 2.3/kmÂ² during the summer (post-whelping) in Texas (Knowlton 1972; Andelt 1985). Density in different geographic areas and seasons are listed in Gese and Bekoff (2004).",Increasing,"<p>Coyotes were originally native to the arid open country of U.S., Canada, and Mexico prior to European settlement (Hody and Kays 2018). During the 19th century, the Coyote expanded into forested biomes they previously hadn't used including eastern deciduous forests, taiga forests of the north, temperate rainforests in the north west, and tropical rainforests in the south. The fragmentation of forests with agriculture, and extinction of larger predators like the Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> and the Jaguar <em>Panthera onca</em>, are thought to have facilitated their expansion. Hybridization with dogs and wolves also played a role in their expansion eastward (Kays <em>et al</em>. 2010; Von Holdt <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coyotes have now&#160;colonized all of North America except for polar areas, and are approaching the border between Central and South America in the Darien region of Panama.</p>","Coyote fur is still sought by trappers throughout its range, with harvest levels depending upon fur prices, local and state regulations, and traditional uses and practices.

Within this broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. The species has a conservative life history, producing only 1 pup on average every 1â3 years and likely has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. The Giant Devilray is a large component of targeted fisheries and a bycatch of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated as <em>Mobula </em>species. The depths and regions used by the Giant Devilray coincide with many artisanal and industrial fisheries raising concerns about previously unreported and continued bycatch. Steep population declines are evident in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including India and Indonesia. The lack of species-specific catch records, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess some population reductions, however notable declines in landings of 50â96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. The Giant Devilray has a widespread global range and in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and strong fisheries management. The Giant Devilray is used locally and sometimes nationally, and often traded internationally, with the rise of the valuable gill plate trade increasing pressure on the species. Unlike for some of the other mobulid species, the development of localized marine protected areas is unlikely to provide this species any significant protection from fisheries due to its large-scale movements.&#160;Based on actual levels of exploitation, steep declining population trends, a conservative life history, and the increasing trade demand, a global population reduction of 50â79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years) is suspected, with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â2056).

Despite a broad worldwide distribution, populations appear to be patchily distributed. Abundance also appears to vary substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they have been, or are currently being, fished. Like many mobulid species, the Giant Devilray is often solitary but may aggregate in large numbers to feed or reproduce. Abundance estimates have been attempted with aerial surveys in some areas like the northwest Mediterranean Sea, where a population of up to 12,700 individuals was estimated (Fortuna <em>et al</em>. 2014, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the population trend is unknown, but it is suspected to be decreasing.<br/><br/>In India, population reductions are suspected based on declines in devilray catches, while effort has increased in several regions, including Kerala, along the Tuticorin coast, and Mumbai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012). Landings data from trawlers operating out of Mumbai revealed maximum landings of 6.3 tonnes (t) for '<em>M. diabolus</em>' (an invalid name, possibly referring at least in part to the Giant Devilray) in 1993â95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996â98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999â2001 and 2002â2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which time fishing effort almost doubled. From this decline in catch and increase in effort, local population declines can be inferred. Such declines are unquantifiable to species-level given the potential grouping of several species under one synonym and the difficulty of identification. In Sri Lanka, fishermen have reported declines in mobulid catches over the past 5 to 10 years as targeted fishing pressure has increased (Fernando and Stevens 2011). Data collected since 2011 shows a steady decline in both 2013 and 2014, although fishing pressure has either remained stable or increased (D. Fernando unpubl. data). Overall, the rate of population reduction of devilrays appears to be high in the region. The scale and effects of devilray fisheries in Sri Lanka and India suggest considerable population reduction regionally (Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, mobulids have been increasingly targeted in many countries, most notably the Philippines and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula </em>spp.' has declined by 63â94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). From 2001â2014, landings of Giant Devilray declined by 96% in Tanjung Luar, and by 50% in Cilacap (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Giant Devilray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Intense, directed fisheries (over 22 active fishery sites) for mobulid species have existed in the Philippines, particularly the Sulu Sea, for over a century with steep historical declines suspected based on fishing effort and landings data (Alava 2002, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). As in Indonesia, depletion is suspected in areas, although targeted fishing continues in some locations (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Throughout most of its range, populations of the Giant Devilray appear to be in decline, due to directed fishing and incidental capture as bycatch. Declines can be inferred in many regions based on declines in landings or sightings concurrent with increasing effort (Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (OâMalley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Regional extinction is suspected in areas with intense and increasing fishing pressure (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). In some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and in the former two countries, strong fisheries management. Globally, based on current levels of exploitation and declining population trends, the suspected population reduction is 50â79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â2056).",Decreasing,"<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>The Giant Devilray is circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters throughout all oceans. Notably, it is present in the Mediterranean Sea but absent in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017) and its occurrence is patchy throughout its distribution (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).

The meat from mobulids is often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles).

The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) added <em>Mobula</em> species to their 'key shark species' list (for assessment only) in 2016 and adopted safe release guidelines in 2017. Proposals to ban retention of <em>Mobula</em> species under the WCPFC and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) have been unsuccessful to date.</p>  <p>On national and local scales, 'Manta' rays tend to be subject to more protections than devilrays.<br/></p>  <p>To allow recovery, it is recommended that mobulid landings be prohibited, in line with several international agreements, at least as long as the global populations are threatened. Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, protocols for safe release, and codes of conduct for responsible tourism are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.

Northern Palearctic populations are mostly found in taiga forests of spruce (<em>Picea</em>) and southern breeders (southern Britain south to the Mediterranean region) in pines (<em>Pinus</em>), including Scots pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>). Race&#160;<em>guillemardi&#160;</em>occupies black pine (<em>Pinus nigra</em>) and race&#160;<em>corsicana&#160;</em>occurs in cultivated Corsican pine (<em>P.n. larico</em>). It also uses larch (<em>Larix</em>), cedar (<em>Cedrus</em>), alder (<em>Alnus</em>) and birch (<em>Betula</em>). In North America it also uses hemlock (<em>Tsuga</em>) and Douglas-fir (<em>Pseudotsuga</em>). In North Africa it breeds mostly in Aleppo pine (<em>Pinus halepensis</em>),&#160;less commonly in maritime pine (<em>Pinus pinaster</em>), almond (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>), walnut (<em>Juglans</em>), poplar (<em>Populus</em>), hornbeam (<em>Carpinus</em>), beech (<em>Fagus</em>), oak (<em>Quercus</em>) and hazel (<em>Corylus</em>). In the Himalayas it is mostly found in high-altitude hemlocks, spruce, fir (<em>Abies</em>) and pine forests. On passage and in the non-breeding season it occurs in pine and deciduous trees in coastal woodlands, parks and gardens, including in suburban areas and city centres, also exceptionally along tideline.&#160;<br/>The breeding season is generally determined by food abundance but is typically from August to April/May in northern and central Europe, mid-January to mid-May in Scandinavia, February to mid-May in northern Russia, March to early November in Cyprus and December-January in the Philippines. It breeds at any time of year in the Indian Subcontinent and in most months in North America. The nest is a deep cup of conifer twigs, bark or rotting wood strips, plant fibres, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair and feathers. It is sited 3â35 m above the ground, usually beneath the outermost foliage, close to the crown of a tall conifer and often close to the trunk in a spruce or along the branch of a pine. Clutches are three to four eggs. The species is resident and a partial migrant and is commonly irruptive and nomadic in the non-breeding season (Clement and Christie 2016).","In Finland, the species has declined due to forest fragmentation. This is principally as a result of overall shortening of rotation times leading to a reduction in the average age of forests. In Canada and the USA, increased logging of old-growth habitats may depress populations because conifers produce their largest cone crops after about 60 years of age. The population in Newfoundland has undergone a steady decline over the last 50 years possibly owing to competition for cone crops from introduced American red squirrels (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</em>) and accelerated logging of old-growth woods (Clement and Christie 2016).","Rich <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated the global population to number 15,000,000 individuals. In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;9,100,000-17,300,000 pairs, which equates to 18,200,000-34,600,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2015).

In Greenland, it is more often found inland than on the coast and prefers wet swampy land in a low carpet of heath, with crowberry (<em>Empetrum</em>) and dwarf birch (<em>Betula glandulosa</em>). On migration and in winter it is found in open areas and farmland (Rising and Christie 2016). Egg-laying generally occurs between May and June. The nest is a cup of dry grass, leaves and moss, lined with hair and feathers, placed on the ground, usually near a clump of vegetation or occasionally under a tipped rock, and generally concealed in vegetation. Clutches are normally four to six eggs. In the breeding season it feeds principally on invertebrates and mainly on seeds in the winter. The species is migratory with European birds wintering mainly in south European Russia and Ukraine and those from Greenland in North America and north-west Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds from Alaska winter further south in North America (Rising and Christie 2016).","As this species feeds in agricultural lands, some mortality may result from the ingestion of pesticides. Large numbers are known to have been killed by collisions on migration. In 1904 an estimated 1,500,000 individuals were killed during a snowstorm in south-west Minnesota and north-west Iowa (Rising and Christie 2016).

In eastern Russia it is mostly found in larches and mainly in spruce and in north-west Russia and Scandinavia mostly in spruce (Clement 2016). The breeding season is from February to mid-May in years of a good seed crop of pine and spruce, but in poor crop years it is delayed to from June to August (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from January to August in North America with timing largely determined by availability of seed crop (Clement 2016). The nest is constructed mostly of conifer twigs, plant stalks, grass stems, lichens, moss, plant fibres and down, animal hair or fur and feathers. It is set 2â20 m above ground against the trunk of a conifer, typically spruce. On occasion it is placed at the end of a branch. Clutches are three to four eggs. The diet consists mainly of conifer seeds, buds, berries and shoots, chiefly of larch and spruce but it also takes a range of invertebrates and larvae (Clement 2016).

It leaves its breeding grounds in late summer (September) to arrive in its wintering grounds across Europe and Asia in October and November (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Populations leave their winter quarters again between March and April, and arrive in their breeding grounds in northern Russia during the second half of May (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. Both the males and females of the species undergo a flightless moult period after breeding and whilst still in their breeding range, during which they congregate at moult gatherings (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong> (males moult their flight feathers between late May and July, females between late June and early September) (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Birds of this species are dispersive during the breeding season and nest in pairs or small groups (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. On passage to their wintering grounds individuals come together in large numbers, and during the non-breeding season the species is highly gregarious, forming close aggregations (4,200 birds were recorded in one wintering flock in Ethiopia) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is chiefly a diurnal feeder (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but is sometimes nocturnal (depending on local disturbances and tides, especially in its non-breeding marine habitats) (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> This species breeds in lowland freshwater marshes, slow-flowing large rivers (Kretchmar 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and shallow lakes and lagoons with ample submerged, floating and emerging vegetation (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Ideal wetland habitats for this species are those surrounded by sparse open forest, woodland and especially agricultural land (Kretchmar 1994, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, in the boreal and subarctic zone (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It avoids tundra, densely forested and mountainous country, as well as fast flowing rivers and streams, but tolerates saline or alkaline steppe lakes and wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>In the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for coastal salt-marshes, freshwater, brackish and saline lagoons (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, flooded grasslands (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, estuaries, intertidal mudflats (Cramp and Simmons 1977)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and other sheltered marine habitats (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> It  is vegetarian and consumes the leaves, seeds, stems and root bulbs of pond weeds, fine grasses (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (especially from agricultural land surrounding lakes) (Jacobsen 1993)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, horsetails (Kretchmar 1994)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and eelgrass, as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Animal material is taken rarely and usually incidentally along with vegetation or seeds (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979, Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nests of this species are shallow depressions in the ground lined with vegetation, usually positioned not far from water and well concealed under overhanging vegetation, in grass tussocks, scrub (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and especially in heather (Jacobsen and Ugelvik 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<p></p>","This species is susceptible to disturbance from freshwater recreational activities (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Grishanov 2006) (e.g. tourists walking) (Mathers <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, pollution (including thallium contamination [Mochizuki, <em>et al.</em> 2005]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, petroleum pollution [Grishanov 2006]<strong></strong>), wetland drainage (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, peat-extraction (e.g. in the Kaliningrad region of Russia) (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and  north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees and human structures provide nest  locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and  broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than  cliff-nesting. It is abundant in temperate (coniferous) rainforest along the north Pacific coast of North America. It generally avoids large cities but is abundant in Anchorage, Alaska and locally abundant in California metropolitan areas (Marzluff 2009). Egg-laying begins in late February  over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia  it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and  bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass,  string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner  cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep  cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building,  sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation  pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an  opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants.  It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and  dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and  invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung,  and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed  (Marzluff 2009). The species is mostly sedentary but northern  populations are liable to move south in winter (Hagemeijer and Blair  1997).","From mid-1600s to mid-1900s or later this species was widely persecuted  due to fear and superstition, resulting in European populations being  reduced, often to point of creating gaps in the species's distribution  (e.g. throughout much northern and central Europe). Persecution still  continues in Iceland and Greenland but throughout the rest of Europe it  is much reduced, allowing the species to recolonize areas it was  previously extirpated from. Increasing populations of this species in much of western U.S.A. have led to conflict and targeted killing campaigns with large numbers shot and poisoned in California, Oregon, Utah and Nevada with limited and short-term benefits to crops and other wildlife (Marzluff 2009). Currently, intensive  farming, the removal of woodland and human disturbance may also affect the  species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.16,000,000 individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004). The European population is estimated at 611,000-1,160,000 pairs, which equates to 1,220,000-2,320,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,,,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Active reintroduction  efforts and increased subsidization, have aided its return to parts of  Germany, the Netherlands, south-east U.S.A.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species inhabits rocky tundra with fairly sparse vegetation or alpine summits. It is rarely found in areas of high shrubs or below the tree line. During winter it lives in less snowy regions or uses windswept ridges and slopes due to its dependence on ground vegetation for food. Laying is generally in June, however birds in Scotland lay from late May and those in Spitsbergen from mid-June (de Juana&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). It typically lays five to eight eggs but sometimes up to twelve (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and some feathers, usually in the open and sheltered by a large stone or shrub. In winter it takes food from the ground, mainly buds and twigs of species including <em>Salix</em>. In the Alps and other southern areas its main winter foods are berry bearing shrubs including <em>Vaccinium</em> and <em>Empetrum</em>. In spring and autumn it has a more varied diet taking leaves, flowers, berries and seeds of a wide range of plants. Most populations make limited movements, which are largely altitudinal and depend on local conditions and weather (de Juana <em>et al</em>. 2016).","The species faces some pressures at a local scale, such as habitat degradation and over-hunting (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is particularly susceptible to over-harvesting in the spring. Most habitat loss occurs due to the development of tourist facilities such as ski facilities and collision with cables around ski stations can cause mortality. Human presence may cause disturbance and displace birds from their wintering habitat. It is thought that, in Sweden, overgrazing from reindeer is causing declines (Storch 2007). A recent decrease detected in the Swiss Alps, of 30% in a decade was attributed to climatic change (de Juana&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Climatic warming in the Arctic has resulted in a rapid expansion of woody shrubs over the past half century which may result in habitat loss for the species (de Juana <em>et al</em>. 2016).","The global population is estimated to number  &gt; c.8,000,000 individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;The European population is estimated at 257,000-1,010,000 pairs, which equates to 514,000-2,020,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Europe forms approximately 10% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is&#160;5,140,000-20,200,000&#160;mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. National population estimates include: &lt;c.100 breeding pairs in China; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs in Japan and   c.100,000-1 million breeding pairs in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex I and II. In most of its European range, the only management is the setting of hunting seasons and bag limits and in Europe it is only protected in a few countries. A small proportion of its range is covered by protective areas, although these are considered to only have a low role in species survival except in those countries at the edge of the range (e.g., Andorra, France, Spain). Most monitoring is limited to the local scale. In Germany a programme to limit human disturbance by ski-touring has been initiated and in Iceland research into the effects of hunting there is ongoing (Storch 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitoring of populations in areas with potentially high hunting pressures should be undertaken to ensure they are sustainable. Measures should be taken in mountain ranges with high tourism to minimise the spatial and temporal overlap between important habitats and recreational activities and their effectiveness monitored. Also, actions to minimize the numbers of generalist predators in these areas should be taken. Research into the impacts of hunting and habitat alteration on population dynamics should be undertaken. More understanding of its migration and dispersal behaviour and the survival of young birds over winter is needed (Storch 2007).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
114128748,91109639,Margaritifera falcata,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-03-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"We used a dataset of western freshwater mussel occurrence records (shells and/or live animals) from nearly 300 sources spanning the 1830s to 2015 (Xerces/CTUIR 2015; full list of contributors at: <a href=""http://www.xerces.org/western-freshwater-mussel-database-contributors/"">http://www.xerces.org/western-freshwater-mussel-database-contributors/</a>). This analysis examined change in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of watershed occupancy from occurrence (presence) data prior to 1990, and from 1990â2015. Based on 646 records dating prior to 1990 and 1,887 records dating 1990â2015, <em>Margaritifera falcata</em> has declined in EOO by 1% (16,816 kmÂ²) but in watershed area by 17% (86,039 kmÂ²).&#160; Decline in watershed area is reinforced by more regional and local abundance observations, especially observations of decline that have been reported since 1990, which are not reflected in the analysis. Recent work by Stagliano (2015) reports that, of 85 populations in Montana, only approximately 20 are considered viable in the next 100 years; a statewide reduction in range was also reported. Thus, future decline is also anticipated. Mock <em>et al</em>. (2013) also report high levels of localised inbreeding range-wide and suggest that possible causes include low dispersal rates and/or high rates of hermaphroditism and selfing due to low population densities.<br/><br/>A number of extant populations in Montana are also currently considered non-viable; indeed, twenty-five percent of surveyed streams where a mussel population was considered non-viable in 2010 are already extirpated (Stagliano 2015). Hovingh (2004) discusses the decline of the species in Utah, implicating loss of native host fishes as a major factor, and recent surveys by Richards (2015) in the Jordan River did not detect the species, despite the speciesâ historical presence in the Jordan drainage and recent intensive survey effort. Similarly, populations in the interior of the species range may also have been more recently extirpated, such as in the Umatilla River of Oregon (Brim Box <em>et al</em>. 2006). Other declines and extirpations have been reported in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington (reviewed in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012), including an estimated decline in extent between 37 and 57% in Idaho (Lysne and Krouse 2011).<br/><br/>Although this species may be locally abundant throughout the range, there have been reports of declines in distribution, population size and/or observation of populations without apparent recruitment in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming (reviewed in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Furnish 2010, Southern California Edison Company 2010, Lysne and Krouse 2011, Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Stagliano 2015, May and Pryor 2016). Howard <em>et al</em>. (2015) found that only 59% of 22 revisited historical sites in California were still occupied by this species. One population numbering as many as 20,000 individuals in 1941, one of the few estimates available for historic population size, was revisited in 2006 and has since declined to ~120 individuals in a 2 km stretch at one site in the Truckee River of California (Murphy 1942, Western Mollusk Sciences 2008, Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). A paucity of abundance data limits accurate assessment of decline in this species when populations decrease but still persist in low numbers. Still, populations in British Columbia appear to be secure (NatureServe 2015), and recent surveys in Wyoming suggest the species is stable there, with numerous individuals and evidence of juvenile recruitment both observed (Mathias and Edwards 2014). The status of the species in Alaska and Nevada is not well understood, although observations have been few (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Margaritifera falcata</em> is a long-lived species (maximum lifespan greater than 100 years; Toy 1998), and populations may be in decline for many years before becoming extirpated, particularly in populations without recent recruitment. This phenomenon has been documented in <em>Margaritifera margaritifera</em> in Britain and Europe (Mollusc Specialist Group, 1996). The Near Threatened category applies to species that do not yet meet the qualifying criteria for the Vulnerable category, but that may be close to qualifying or are likely to become threatened if existing conservation actions diminish or cease (IUCN 2016). Evidence that reduced population size often precedes population extirpation suggests that the declines in EOO and watershed area underestimate decline in population size for this species. Based on reports of more recent population extirpations in parts of the range and observations of large declines in population abundance, a reduction in watershed area of 17% indicates a greater decline in population size, thus approaching the 30% threshold for Vulnerable. Therefore, the species is currently considered Near Threatened.<br/><p></p>","<em>Margaritifera falcata</em> inhabits perennial rivers, streams and creeks at depths of 1.5 to 5 feet, and they tend to congregate in areas with boulders and gravel substrate, with some sand, silt and clay (summarized in Roscoe and Redelings 1964). This species prefers clear, cold water (Frest and Johannes 1995), and has been found at multiple elevations, including waterways above 5,000 feet (Smith, pers. comm. 2010) and even 8,000 feet (Mathias, pers. comm. 2016). The species occurs in waterways with low velocities, low shear stress and stable substrates (Howard and Cuffey 2003, Vannote and Minshall 1982, Stone <em>et al</em>. 2004, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013). <em>Margaritifera falcata</em> is frequently found in eddies or pools (Howard and Cuffey 2003) and areas with stones or boulders that likely shelter mussel beds from scour during flood events (Vannote and Minshall 1982); indeed, mussel beds appear to occupy the most stable areas of the river bed (May and Pryor 2015). This species appears to be intolerant of sedimentation; in the Salmon River of Idaho, mussels that were covered with sand and gravel were unable to uncover themselves and ultimately perished (Vannote and Minshall 1982).<br/><br/>Like other margaritiferids, <em>M. falcata</em> requires a host fish to complete development. Glochidia (the larval stage) are released from April through July in northern California (Murphy 1942, Spring Rivers 2007) and March to June in Oregon (Meyers and Milleman 1977, Karna and Milleman 1978, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Glochidia are released as a white conglutinate similar in shape to mussel brood chambers or gills. Several species of host fish have been confirmed (i.e., glochidial infestation of the fish has been observed in the wild and metamorphosis of the glochidia has also been observed) or are considered potential hosts (either glochidia infestation has been observed only under artificial conditions or glochidial metamorphosis has not been observed; OâBrien and Brim Box 1999, OâBrien and Williams 2002, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Confirmed native and nonnative host fish include Coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>), Chinook Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>), Cutthroat Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus clarkii</em>), Rainbow Trout/Steelhead Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>), and Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>) (Murphy 1942, Karna and Milleman 1978). Potential native and non-native host fish include Bull Trout (<em>Salvelinus confluentus</em>), Kokanee Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus nerka kennerlyi</em>), Lahontan Redside (<em>Richardsonius egregius</em>), Prickly Sculpin (<em>Cottus asper</em>), Speckled Dace (<em>Rhinichthys osculus robustus</em>), Tahoe Sucker (<em>Catostomus tahoensis</em>), Threespine Stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>), and Brook Trout (<em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em>) (Murphy 1942, Meyers and Milleman 1977, Karna and Milleman 1978, Steg unpub. obs. cited in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012).","<p>Threats to <em>Margaritifera falcata</em> and other species of freshwater mussels in North America include: impoundments and loss or decline of host fish, channel modification from channelization, dredging and mining, restoration activities that impact streambanks or streambeds or dewater channels, contamination, sedimentation and scouring, nutrient enrichment, water withdrawal and diversion, thermal pollution, livestock grazing in riparian areas, shoreline development, and the introduction of non-native plant, fish and invertebrate species (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Many of these impacts, especially a reduction in stream flow and thermal pollution in arid areas, are being exacerbated by climate change.&#160; Additionally, the species may be threatened by low genetic diversity as a result of recent population reductions, although it is difficult to detect the molecular signature of a genetic bottleneck for species with hermaphroditic life histories (Mock <em>et al</em>. 2013). Multiple salmonid host fish are listed as endangered or threatened in parts of their range under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Declines in host speciesâ population size and distribution may have significant impacts on this species.<br/><strong></strong></p>","Where present, <em>M. falcata</em> may occur in dense beds containing as many as 20,000 individuals (Truckee River, California; Murphy 1942). In the Siletz River on the Oregon Coast, Karna and Milleman (1978) reported a colony of approximately 100,000 <em>M. falcata</em> near River mile 21, with densities exceeding 400 individuals/mÂ². Other researchers have observed a maximum of ~230 individuals/mÂ² (North Fork John Day River, Oregon; Brim Box <em>et al</em>. 2006) or much smaller aggregations (50-100 individuals in the South Fork Eel River, California; Howard and Cuffey 2003). Stagliano (2015) reports mussel aggregations containing one to generally no more than 50 individuals in Montana. Allard <em>et al</em>. (2015) also report between 0 and 55 individuals/mÂ², with an average density of 9.5 individuals/mÂ² in Merrill Creek, Oregon.<br/><br/>Although this species may be locally abundant throughout the range, there have been reports of declines in distribution, population size and/or observation of populations without apparent recruitment in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming (reviewed in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Furnish 2010, Southern California Edison Company 2010, Lysne and Krouse 2011, Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Stagliano 2015, May and Pryor 2016).

It is also found in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, western Montana and Wyoming, and northern Utah and Nevada. One spurious record previously reported for the Bill Williams River in Arizona in 1993 (WCMAFE/BLM/USUNAMC, 2015) has since been corrected to âUnionoidaâ, as Margaritifera falcata is not known to occur in the state (Myers, pers. comm. 2015). Indeed, although R.E. Call (1884) reported the species âsouth to Arizonaâ, Walker (1916) considered any occurrence in Arizona as âvery doubtfulâ and no other records support the speciesâ occurrence there. Myers (2009) has discussed the presence of <em>Margaritifera</em> shells in the Colorado River basin, concluding that the shells have been transported from outside the basin. The geographic range of the species is poorly understood in Alaska, where multiple records have been reported from the Alaskan panhandle, but a single specimen was also reported from the Deshka River, 1,000 km northwest of the northernmost panhandle records (Gelvin-Reymiller, pers. comm. 2009). Similarly, the status of populations in Nevada is poorly understood; Hovingh (2004) reported no observations of the species in Nevada, though there are now records of the species as recent as 2012 from three sites in northern Nevada. Nearly three times as many observations of this species have been reported since 1990 compared to pre-1990.<br/><br/>This species is the only native western freshwater mussel with populations reported in southern California between 1990 and 2015, despite recent surveys in many historical sites for this and other species. At least one of three reported populations in the Kern River Basin was noted as having multiple age classes (Palenscar, pers. comm. 2015); however, other recent surveys of two historical sites in the Kern Basin found no extant populations (Hovingh 2004, Furnish 2010, Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><p></p><p></p>","Freshwater mussels have cultural significance for First Nations and Tribes in western North America, including as a traditional food resource (COSEWIC 2003, CTUIR 2015).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Few abundance estimates are available for existing populations, and anecdotal declines have been reported across the range, although causes of these declines are not well understood.

This analysis examined change in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of watershed occupancy from occurrence (presence) data prior to 1990, and from 1990â2015. Based on 736 records dating prior to 1990 and 942 records dating 1990-2015, <em>Anodonta nuttalliana</em> has declined in EOO by 9% (208,031 kmÂ²) but in watershed area by 33% (120,427 kmÂ²). This analysis includes occurrence records for both <em>A. nuttalliana</em> and <em>A. californiensis</em> (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bieler 2015). Range contractions are evident in southern California and Arizona, as well as in other western states. These occurrence-based declines are reinforced by range-wide genetic research and regional and local abundance observations, especially observations of decline that have been reported since 1990, which are not reflected in the analysis. For example, Mock <em>et al</em>. (2004) has shown that population-level nuclear genetic diversity in Utah populations is low and that populations may now be isolated, two characteristics that may increase the risk of local extinctions. A population at Redden Spring in Utah may be of particular concern, as this site is isolated and contains incredibly low genetic diversity as compared even to other Utah populations (Mock <em>et al</em>. 2004, Mock <em>et al</em>. 2010). Mock <em>et al</em>. (2010) also found that populations within major hydrologic basins across the west are distinct enough to be considered evolutionarily significant units and possibly distinct management units. Several populations exhibit evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck; thus, even declines limited to certain hydrologic basins may have a disproportionate effect on future extinction risk in this species.<br/><br/>Populations in Nevada were once abundant (Call 1884), and though the species still persists, it now appears absent in the Lahontan and Humboldt basins in part of northwestern Nevada and scarce in other historic locations (reviewed in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Hovingh 2004, Smith unpub. data 2009). Recent surveys in Wyoming also suggest that the species may be more imperilled than previously recognized. In a survey of 23 sites, only 13 total <em>Anodonta</em> were found, comprised of only larger, older individuals (Mathias and Edwards 2014). Indeed recent surveys by Howard <em>et al</em>. (2015) found that the species has been extirpated from all resurveyed historical southern California sites (n = 14; though the species was observed in the Bishop Creek Canal in Inyo County). Populations of <em>Anodonta</em> in northern California also appear to be declining in total population size and in number of populations (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Although a number of watersheds in the lower Colorado River Basin of Arizona indicate recent occupancy of <em>Anodonta</em>, work by Myers (2009) suggests that the species began its decline in Arizona <em>circa </em>1960, following extensive habitat destruction and alteration. Since 1990, live <em>Anodonta</em> have been reported only from the Black River Basin; recent records from the Little Colorado basin are based on shells and shell fragments. Within the Black River Basin, surveys conducted more recently (post-2000) suggest that populations there have also declined (Myers 2009). This analysis is unable to detect declines that have occurred since 1990, since changes in extent of occurrence have been calculated using data before and after 1990, which may underestimate actual population declines. Portions of the Yaqui and GuzmÃ¡n basins of southern Arizona and northern Mexico are still inhabited, but recent surveys of historical sites and observations by local residents indicate the species is no longer common (Myers, unpub. data 2008). Thus, decline in this region is likely higher than suggested by this analysis.<br/><br/>The status of the species in Idaho is unstudied, but anecdotal declines have been reported in both Oregon and Washington (reviewed in Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012), and state natural heritage programs consider the species critically imperilled in Washington and possibly Oregon and imperilled in Idaho (NatureServe 2015). Populations in British Columbia are listed as âapparently secureâ (NatureServe 2015). Given observations of population declines and extirpations and the reduction in extent of occurrence and watershed area over the last 25 years, a decline in population equal to or greater than 30% over the past three generations (with generation length being estimated at eight years) is inferred, and this species should be considered Vulnerable.","This species has been reported from many types of habitats, including low elevation ponds, reservoirs, lakes, creeks, and rivers and may co-occur with <em>Anodonta oregonensis</em> (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Nedeau <em>et al</em>. 2009). In rivers, <em>Anodonta</em> may be found in both pools and runs (Hegeman 2012), although it is found almost solely in pools in the South Fork Eel River (Howard and Cuffey 2003).<br/><br/>As with other unionids, <em>A. nuttalliana</em> requires a host fish to complete development. <em>Anodonta</em> glochidia (the larval stage) have been observed in northern California during all months of the year except September and October (Spring Rivers, 2007) and in June and July in Oregon (OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013) and are released in âa sticky, rust-colored, web-like massâ (OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Several species of host fish have been confirmed (i.e., glochidial infestation of the fish has been observed in the wild and metamorphosis of the glochidia has also been observed) or are considered potential hosts for <em>Anodonta</em> (either glochidia infestation has been observed only under artificial conditions or glochidial metamorphosis has not been observed; OâBrien and Brim Box 1999, OâBrien and Williams 2002, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013), and this species appears to be a host-fish generalist (OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Confirmed native and non-native host fish reported for <em>A. nuttalliana</em> and synonymous species include Hardhead (<em>Mylopharodon conocephalus</em>), Pit Sculpin (<em>Cottus pitensis</em>), Redside Shiner (<em>Richardsonius balteatus</em>), Sacramento Pikeminnow (<em>Ptychocheilus grandis</em>), Speckled Dace (<em>Rhinichthys osculus</em>), Threespine Stickleback (<em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em>), Torrent Sculpin (<em>Cottus rhotheus</em>), Tule Perch (<em>Hysterocarpus traski</em>), and Green Sunfish (<em>Lepomis cyanellus</em>) (Spring Rivers 2007, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013, Maine <em>et al</em>. 2016). Potential native and non-native host fish reported for <em>A. nuttalliana</em> and synonymous species include Chiselmouth (<em>Acrocheilus alutaceus</em>), Longnose Dace (<em>Rhinichthys cataractae</em>), Margined Sculpin (<em>Cottus marginatus</em>), Northern Pikeminnow (<em>Ptychocheilus oregonensis</em>), Peamouth (<em>Mylocheilus caurinus</em>), Sucker (<em>Catostomus</em> sp.), and Mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>) (D'Eliscu 1972, Lang 1998, Spring Rivers 2007, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013, Maine <em>et al</em>. 2016).","<p>Threats to <em>Anodonta nuttalliana</em> and other species of freshwater mussels in North America include: impoundments and loss or decline of host fish, channel modification from channelisation, dredging and mining, restoration activities that impact streambanks or streambeds or dewater channels, contamination, sedimentation and scouring, nutrient enrichment, water withdrawal and diversion, thermal pollution, livestock grazing in riparian areas, shoreline development, and the introduction of non-native plant, fish and invertebrate species (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Many of these impacts, especially a reduction in stream flow and thermal pollution in arid areas, are being exacerbated by climate change.&#160; Several host fish species, such as sculpin and dace, are rather sedentary relative to host fish for other western freshwater mussel species (such as <em>Margaritifera falcata</em>, whose salmonid host fish may range hundreds of miles), and declines in host speciesâ population size and distribution may also have significant impacts on this species. Mock <em>et al</em>. (2010) also found that populations exhibit pronounced geographic structure with regard to hydrologic basin and some may have experienced recent genetic bottlenecks. Thus even threats limited to only a subset of populations or within a subset of hydrologic basins may have a disproportionate effect on future extinction risk in this species.<br/><strong></strong></p>","As with geographic distribution, knowledge of population abundance and trend is confounded by the identification of <em>Anodonta</em> species using shell morphology. Where found, populations of <em>Anodonta</em> may be locally common or abundant (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Xerces/CTUIR 2015, Brim Box <em>et al</em>. 2006) or sparsely distributed or rare (Brim Box <em>et al</em>. 2006, Hovingh 2004, Hegeman 2012, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2013). <em>Anodonta</em> density has been reported as low as 0.52 mussels/mÂ² (Hegeman, 2012) and as high as ~275 individuals/mÂ² (Brim Box <em>et al</em>. 2006) in the Middle Fork John Day River, Oregon.<br/><br/>Decline in watershed area is reinforced by more regional and local abundance observations, especially observations of decline that have been reported since 1990, which are not reflected in the analysis. Recent surveys in Wyoming suggest that the species may be more imperilled than previously recognised. In a survey of 23 sites, only 13 total <em>Anodonta</em> were found, comprised of only larger, older individuals (Mathias and Edwards 2014). Indeed recent surveys by Howard <em>et al</em>. (2015) found that the species has been extirpated from all resurveyed historical southern California sites (n = 14; though the species was observed in the Bishop Creek Canal in Inyo County). Populations of <em>Anodonta</em> in northern California also appear to be declining in total population size and in number of populations (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arizona since 1990, live <em>Anodonta</em> have been reported only from the Black River Basin; recent records from the Little Colorado basin are based on shells and shell fragments. Within the Black River Basin, surveys conducted more recently (post-2000) suggest that populations there have also declined (Myers 2009).",Decreasing,"<p>Understanding of this speciesâ geographic range is confounded by difficulties associated with the identification of <em>Anodonta</em> species using shell morphology. Based on historic and recent collections and observations, it appears that this species is found from southern British Columbia south to northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and east to Utah, Arizona, and western Wyoming. The species appears to now be extirpated from all of southern California (as defined by the southernmost 10 counties of the state) and most of the lower Colorado River Basin, which spans Arizona, Nevada, and California. Specimens of <em>Anodonta </em>from the Yaqui River Basin and GuzmÃ¡n Basin of Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico have been variously identified as <em>Anodonta impura</em>, <em>A. dejecta</em>, <em>A. mearnsiana</em>, <em>A. exilior</em>, <em>A. coarctata</em>, <em>A. californiensis</em>, and <em>A. wahlametensis</em>. However, recent research by Myers (2009, 2012) and Culver <em>et al</em>. (2012) suggests that <em>Anodonta</em> from these basins are most closely related to populations of <em>Anodonta</em> from the Owens and Black River basins of California and Arizona. <em>Anodonta</em> collected from other basins in Mexico appear to be more closely related to other species of <em>Anodonta</em> that do not occur in the U.S. (Culver <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thus, the records from the Yaqui River Basin and GuzmÃ¡n Basin of Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico likely represent the southern extent of this cladeâs range.<br/></p>","Freshwater mussels have cultural significance for First Nations and Tribes in western North America, including as a traditional food resource (COSEWIC 2003, CTUIR 2015).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>This species is easily confused with other western Anodonta, and protection of all <em>Anodonta</em> populations from known threats is recommended; remediation of known threats should be prioritized.

114131600,189487,Anodonta oregonensis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"We used a dataset of western freshwater mussel occurrence records (shells and/or live animals) from nearly 300 sources spanning the 1830s to 2015 (Xerces/CTUIR 2015; full list of contributors at: <a href=""http://www.xerces.org/western-freshwater-mussel-database-contributors/"">http://www.xerces.org/western-freshwater-mussel-database-contributors/</a>). This analysis examined change in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of watershed occupancy from occurrence (presence) data prior to 1990, and from 1990â2015. Based on 371 records dating prior to 1990 and 758 records dating 1990â2015, <em>Anodonta oregonensis</em> has declined in EOO by 9% (231,834 kmÂ²) but in watershed area by 26% (69,474 kmÂ²). This analysis includes occurrence records for both <em>A. oregonensis</em> and <em>A. kennerlyi</em> (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bieler 2015). Estimates are also dependent on a number of assumptions regarding historical and recent distribution. Based on a review of 235 historical museum specimens or photos of specimens (Blevins <em>et al</em>., unpub. data 2015) using morphological analyses to differentiate western Anodonta (Chong 2006, Hegeman <em>et al</em>. unpub. manuscript 2015), historic records for this species in Utah, Nevada, and southern California were considered in error; no measured specimens were identified as <em>A. oregonensis</em> based on measures of both length to height ratio and anterior slope angle. Healthy reproducing populations have been reported in the lower Columbia Basin in Washington and Oregon.

In rivers, <em>Anodonta</em> may be found in both pools and runs (Hegeman 2012). As with other unionids, <em>A. oregonensis</em> requires a host fish to complete development. Host fish species may be confirmed (i.e., glochidial infestation of the fish has been observed in the wild and metamorphosis of the glochidia has also been observed) or may be considered potential hosts (either glochidia infestation has been observed only under artificial conditions or glochidial metamorphosis has not been observed; OâBrien and Brim Box 1999, OâBrien and Williams 2002, OâBrien <em>et al</em>. 2013). Confirmed native and non-native host fish include Prickly Sculpin (<em>Cottus asper</em>) and Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Martel and Lauzon-Guay 2005). Potential native and non-native host fish include Chinook Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>), Coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>), Cutthroat Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus clarkii</em>), Dolly Varden (<em>Salvelinus malma</em>), Margined Sculpin (<em>Cottus marginatus</em>), Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>), Redside Shiner (<em>Richardsonius balteatus</em>), and Speckled Dace (<em>Rhinichthys osculus</em>) (Moles 1983, Martel and Lauzon-Guay 2005, Maine and OâBrien unpub. data 2016). Other host fish may include Hardhead (<em>Mylopharodon conocephalus</em>), Pit Sculpin (<em>Cottus pitensis</em>), Sacramento Pikeminnow (<em>Ptychocheilus grandis</em>), Tule Perch (<em>Hysterocarpus traski</em>), and Green Sunfish (<em>Lepomis cyanellus</em>) (Spring Rivers 2007).<br/></p>","<p>Threats to freshwater mussels in North America include: impoundments and loss or decline of host fish, channel modification from channelisation, dredging and mining, restoration activities that impact streambanks or streambeds or dewater channels, contamination, sedimentation and scouring, nutrient enrichment, water withdrawal and diversion, thermal pollution, livestock grazing in riparian areas, shoreline development, and the introduction of non-native plant, fish and invertebrate species (Jepsen <em>et al</em>. 2012).

114251609,41687,Ursus americanus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widespread and occupies a large portion of its historical range. The global population is estimated at more than twice that of all other species of bears combined.&#160;Within the United States, populations have been expanding numerically and geographically.&#160;Legal hunting is the primary cause of mortality and is well controlled by state and provincial management agencies in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.&#160;Hunting is banned in Mexico.&#160;Population-level threats exist in only a few isolated places, and relate mainly to habitat fragmentation and conflicts between bears and people. Many management agencies are more concerned with controlling population growth of this species through legal harvest than promoting further growth and geographic expansion (which could increase humanâbear conflicts).</p>","<p>American black bears are primarily a species of temperate and boreal forests, but they also range into subtropical areas of Florida and Mexico as well as into the subarctic. They live at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,500 m, and inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican deserts and scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the grizzly bear; Veitch and Harrington 1996).&#160; Between these extremes they occupy assorted deciduous and coniferous forest types, each providing a different array of foods.<br/> <br/> The American black bear is a generalist, opportunist omnivore. Depending on location and season, they consume herbaceous vegetation, roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion.&#160; Moreover, they readily consume various human-related foods, from garbage and birdseed to a variety of agricultural products from cropfields and orchards, including corn, oats, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, and apples, and brood and honey in apiaries.&#160; Black bear predation upon livestock has also been documented in some areas. The ability of black bears to adjust their diet to the circumstances has enabled them to persist not only in a diversity of habitat types, but also in highly fragmented forested areas in proximity to humans (Pelton 2003, Benson and Chamberlain 2006, Ditmer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> A key habitat feature in many areas is a source of fall mast that enables black bears to increase their fat reserves for winter hibernation.&#160; Historically, American chestnuts (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) likely were a key fall food for bears (and other wildlife) in eastern North America, but after a blight eliminated this food source in the early and mid-1900s, oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) acorns and beechnuts (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) have become the principal fall foods for bears throughout this region (Vaughan 2002).&#160; However, oaks are now declining in eastern North America due to forestry practices, insects, disease, and over-abundance of deer (McShea <em>et al. </em>2007), and a disease accidentally introduced in the late 1800s is now spreading widely across beech forests in northeastern U.S. (Morin <em>et al. </em>2007). In parts of the range where oaks and beech are absent or uncommon, hazelnuts (<em>Corylus</em> spp.), whitebark pine nuts (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) berries, madrone (<em>Arbutus xalapensis</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos</em> spp.), huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium </em>spp.), buffaloberries (<em>Shepherdia canadensis</em>), wild cherries (<em>Prunus </em>sp.), mountain ash (<em>Sorbus </em>spp.), or other fruits, or sometimes meat, are the fall dietary mainstays.&#160; In the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, succulents such as yucca (<em>Yucca</em> spp.) and cactus fruits also play important roles in providing food, especially during drought (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160; American black bears may migrate considerable distances (up to 200 km) to find more abundant food sources, especially in late summer and fall, prior to hibernation (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Beck 1991, Hellgren <em>et al. </em>2005, Noyce and Garshelis 2011).<br/> <br/> American black bears hibernate for up to 7 months in the northern portions of their range (Bertram and Vivion 2002, Chaulk <em>et al. </em>2005), but for considerably shorter periods in more southerly areas (Wooding and Hardisky 1992, Waller <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; In some southern and low-elevation areas, where food is available year-round, some bears may remain active during winter (Hellgren and Vaughan 1987, Graber 1990, Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Hightower <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; However, all parturient females den to give birth to cubs, typically in JanuaryâFebruary.&#160; American black bears use a wide variety of den structures: existing caves or tree cavities, underground chambers that they excavate, root masses, brush piles, or even above-ground nests. Adequate denning sites or structures are rarely thought to be limiting, except in habitats that flood (because young cubs may drown or die of exposure; White <em>et al.</em> 2001), or where bears preferentially choose certain types of dens, such as hollow trees, that are being reduced through logging (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Mating typically occurs in MayâJuly, but may be extended in southern latitudes (Garshelis and Hellgren 1994, Spady <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Females can have as many as 3 estrous cycles (B. Durrant, personal communication, 2014). Implantation is delayed, and active gestation is only 2 months.&#160; Females give birth beginning at age 3â10 years: their rate of growth and maturity varies with food availability, and hence tends to be especially delayed in northern boreal forests.&#160; They can produce cubs every other year, but in places with less food, this interval may be extended to 3 years.&#160; Average litter size is approximately 2.5 cubs in eastern (ranging up to 5 or rarely 6 cubs) versus &lt;2.0 cubs in western North America (Alt 1989, Garshelis 1994, Bridges <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160; Reproductive rate in this species is highest among the ursids, although there is a clear dichotomy between Eastern (including Midwestern) and Western populations.</p>","<p>Throughout most of its range, this species is not threatened.&#160;Legal sport hunting is well controlled by state and provincial agencies to fit management objectives, and most states and provinces that harvest bears have a management plan (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;American black bears are harvested as a game species in all 12 Canadian provinces and territories where they exist and in 31 U.S. states.&#160;Since the early 2000s, 6 states with increasing bear populations opened bear hunting seasons â Florida, New Jersey and Maryland, after 21-, 33- and 51-year closures, respectively, and Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Nevada for the first time in their management history. The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000â50,000 annually.&#160;Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.<br/> <br/> A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality.&#160;A very small (&lt;20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin <em>et al. </em>2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe <em>et al. </em>2007). A black bear population on a large island in QuÃ©bec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (CÃ´tÃ© 2005).<br/> <br/> Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast â most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people).&#160;As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5â7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005).&#160;However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato <em>et al. </em>2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.&#160; In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.<br/> <br/> Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.&#160; Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.&#160; Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.âMexican border (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/> <br/> Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Humanâbear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.&#160; Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.&#160; Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of humanâbear conflict levels (Howe <em>et al. </em>2010, Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2007, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen <em>et al. </em>2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.<br/> <br/> Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.&#160; Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).</p>","<p>Heavily persecuted since European settlement of North America, compounded by loss of forest cover, American black bear populations rapidly declined, and probably reached a nadir in the early 1900s. Greater state and provincial protection for bears enabled populations to slowly recover.&#160; More rapid growth occurred with increasing protective measures since the late 1980s (Williamson 2002).&#160; By 1999, 60% of U.S. and Canadian states and provinces reported increasing populations, and other jurisdictions appeared to be either stable or fluctuating with no clear trend (Garshelis and Hristienko 2006).&#160; Many of these trend assessments, though, were not derived from serial estimates of population size.<br/> <br/> Based on sums of estimates for individual states, the total U.S. population, excluding Alaska, is estimated at somewhat greater than 300,000.&#160; No reliable estimate exists for numbers of black bears in Alaska, although authorities presume there to be 100,000â200,000 animals.&#160; Similarly, large populations in most parts of Canada are not reliably known, but countrywide estimates center around 450,000 (principally in British Columbia, Ontario, and QuÃ©bec).&#160;Thus, the total number of black bears in North America is likely within the range 850,000â950,000.&#160; No population estimates exist for the country of Mexico, although some areas within Mexico have high and increasing black bear densities (SEMARNAP 1999, Doan-Crider 2003).<br/> <br/> Many population size or density estimates have been derived using rigorous markârecapture approaches.&#160;Densities have been reported as high as 155 independent black bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (on an Alaskan island with legal hunting and abundant natural foods; Peacock <em>et al. </em>2011) and 214 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (coastal North Carolina with abundant agricultural crops consumed by bears; van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012) to as low as 5 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (interior Alaska; Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997; and pine forest with little food or cover in coastal South Carolina; Drewry <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Some markârecapture population estimates have been conducted over large geographic areas, encompassing whole states or provinces or numerous study sites across the state or province (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ontario: Garshelis and Visser 1997, Garshelis and Noyce 2006, Dreher <em>et al.</em> 2007, Belant <em>et al. </em>2011, Howe <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lackey <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Population trend information is also commonly derived from markârecapture or from population reconstruction or modelling using ages of legally-harvested bears (Fieberg et al. 2010).&#160; Population size and trend information are routinely used by management agencies to regulate harvest pressure and inform trends in humanâbear conflicts.&#160; Detailed demographic studies have revealed that survival and recruitment of American black bears is closely tied to year-to-year variation in natural food abundance (Costello <em>et al. </em>2003, Reynolds-Hogland <em>et al. </em>2007, Obbard and Howe 2008, McCall <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Once portrayed as having one of the lowest rates of reproduction of any land mammal in North America, American black bears in some parts of the range, especially in the East and Midwest, are now known to have higher reproductive rates than previously reported (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160; With controls on human-caused mortality, populations can increase rapidly, and spread through immigration. A black bear population in interior Alaska that was almost entirely removed to reduce predation on moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) completely recovered in 4â6 years by immigration (of both sexes) from the surrounding landscape (Keech <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>",Increasing,"<p>American black bears range across three countries: 12 provinces and territories of Canada (all except Prince Edward Island, where they were once abundant, but the last known one shot in 1927; Sobey 2007); 41 U.S. states (with sightings but undefined ranges in 5 other states); and 6 states of northern Mexico (Scheick and McCown 2014) (with sightings in 4 other Mexican states and a recent record of a dead bear farther south in the state of Hidalgo; Rojas-MartÃ­nez and JuÃ¡rez-Casillas 2013). The species never existed outside of these three countries, although the southern historic limit is not well known. The present range falls within 69Â°29Â´ to 23Â°14Â´ N (with the incidental record in Hidalgo at 21Â°05â30â N) and 52Â°49Â´ to 164Â°10Â´W.<br/> <br/> In western parts of their range, American black bears broadly overlap and compete with grizzly/brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) (Mattson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013). Black bears occupy several islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, but do not coexist with brown bears on any islands.&#160; Northward, black bears narrowly overlap with polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) along the QuÃ©bec coast of Ungava peninsula, the Ontario and QuÃ©bec coasts of James Bay, and along the Ontario and Manitoba coasts of Hudson Bay.&#160; Climate change seems to have enabled black bears to range farther north. For example, there have been recent sightings of black bears near Salluit, the second northernmost Inuit community in QuÃ©bec (62Â°12'N) (S. CÃ´tÃ©, Laval University, QuÃ©bec City, personal communication, 2015).&#160; Along the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut, local hunters from the community of Arviat (61Â°5'N) have observed black bears about 50 km west of the village.&#160; These sightings have occurred since 2005, were of single individuals, and are considered to be rare (D. Lee, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, personal communication, 2014) but are farther north than similarly rare excursions noted by Jonkel and Miller (1970).<br/> <br/> Loss of habitat and unregulated hunting/persecution resulted in extirpation of black bears across large portions of their range by the early 1900s.&#160; Present occupied range covers 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, representing 65â75% of the historical range, depending on whether Midwestern prairies are counted as historical range (Scheick and McCown 2014). &#160;Black bears were documented along some wooded river courses through the Great Plains (e.g., Lewis and Clark expedition, 1804â1806; Laliberte and Ripple 2003), but were likely scarce in the grasslands. More of the original distribution remains in Canada (&gt;95%; 6.9 million km<sup>2</sup>) than the U.S. (45â60%; 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>). However, recolonization from growing neighboring populations, in some cases assisted by translocations, have occurred across the U.S., including several previously extirpated states: Rhode Island and Connecticut in the Northeast (Cardoza 1976, Scheick and McCown 2014), Kentucky in the Southeast (Unger <em>et al</em>. 2013), Ohio, Oklahoma and Missouri in the Midwest (Bales <em>et al</em>. 2005, Scheick and McCown 2014, Wilton <em>et al</em>. 2014; although genetic studies suggest that Missouri bears may not have been completely extirpated â Faries et al. 2013, Puckett <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Texas (Onorato and Hellgren 2001) and Nevada in the Southwest (including areas that were erroneously thought to be outside historic range; Lackey<em> et al</em>. 2013). The current distribution in Mexico (at least 99,000 km<sup>2</sup>) is believed to have been drastically reduced from an unknown historical extent due to deforestation, hunting, and incidental killing from predator poisoning (DelfÃ­n-Alfonso <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, these bears are also now expanding and reoccupying portions of their former range, and possibly new areas because of artificial water and food sources.</p>","<p>A looming concern, but not a widespread problem in North America, is the poaching of bears for their paws and gall bladders, which may be sold commercially. Those products, particularly bile from gall bladders, are highly valued by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.&#160; Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces allow the sale of bear parts taken legally by hunters, either within that jurisdiction or transported into that jurisdiction from elsewhere (Williamson 2002). An argument can be made that this creates opportunities for poachers to employ an illicit pathway into the legal, commercial trade. However, illegal trade appears to be very limited.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>n the U.S. and Canada, black bears are managed by individual states and provinces, so although an IUCN conservation action plan exists for this species (Pelton et al. 1999), each state and province sets their own goals and methods for achieving those goals.&#160; As a whole, this has worked well to re-establish robust populations of black bears across their range. Several key factors aided the rapid rebound of American black bears since the 1980s: (1) improved habitat, (2) large dispersal distances in high-quality habitat (Moore et al. 2014), (3) relatively high reproductive rates, (4) reduced human-caused mortality, and (5) better information about the biology and ecology of bears combined with better population monitoring techniques (Miller 1990).<br/> <br/> Much forested habitat, essential for black bears, was cleared indiscriminately for agriculture during the 1700sâmid-1900s, but has since returned in many parts of the U.S. Most notably, northeastern U.S. (New England) has been naturally reforested back to near its pre-colonial extent (~400 years ago; Hall <em>et al. </em>2002), although tree composition is different (fewer hard mast-producing trees as food for bears; Thompson <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Some states and provinces also manage habitat to benefit bears (e.g., space, foods, travelways, den sites; Pelton <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/> <br/> Through the 1800s and early 1900s in some areas, black bears were extensively hunted for meat, skins, and grease (i.e., market hunting; Smith <em>et al. </em>1991, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013) or hunted or poisoned with the intent of eliminating or severely reducing their numbers to reduce damage to crops and livestock (Cardoza 1976, Raybourne 1987).&#160; Governments often paid a bounty to encourage the killing of black bears.&#160; Protection and recovery occurred state-by-state and province-by-province during 1902â1983 as laws were changed and bears gained protection as a big game species (Miller 1990).&#160;Thereafter, the number and sex of bears killed were more closely controlled through hunting regulations and restrictions on numbers of hunters.&#160; By the 1980s, under the belief that black bears reproduced slowly and were easily over-harvested, most management agencies took a conservative approach to black bear hunting to enable populations to increase (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;Moreover, an infrastructure of wildlife management agency personnel and hunters policed illegal take.<br/> <br/> Wildlife management agencies have also taken an increasingly active role in reducing the number of bears killed in conflict situations through stricter laws against shooting and feeding (in some jurisdictions, feeding bears is illegal), and educational programs aimed at coexisting with bears by reducing attractants, promoting public tolerance, and recognizing that black bears are typically not a threat to human safety (Treves <em>et al. </em>2009, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> In Mexico all hunting seasons for American black bears have been closed since 1985, and the species is considered nationally endangered.&#160;Numerous conservation initiatives established by large private ranches and land cooperatives in northern Mexico have created large blocks of suitable habitat (e.g., oak-dominated forests) with protection from poaching (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160;Changing public attitudes toward bears in Mexico have also contributed to the recovery and expansion of the species (SEMARNAP 1999, Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Although bear populations are clearly increasing, population estimation and monitoring efforts are lacking because funding (normally associated with hunting fees in the U.S. and Canada) is not available.&#160;Hunting bans will likely not be lifted without better documentation of population size and trend.<br/> <br/> In the southeastern U.S., where black bears now occupy 27â37% of their historic range (depending on whether primary range or total bear range are counted as occupied range; Scheick and McCown 2014), population recovery was aided by the establishment of national parks and other sanctuaries in the Appalachian Mountains and the Coastal Plain (Pelton and van Manen 1997).&#160;These large areas protect the habitat (especially mast-producing trees) and restrict hunter access.&#160;Beginning in the early 1970s, additional areas were established where bear hunting was prohibited, thus linking protected areas to other forested lands, including many private lands.&#160;the resulting conglomerates serve as dedicated or defacto sanctuaries, especially for adult females, that are a source for bears expanding into other areas (Beringer <em>et al. </em>1998, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> In some areas, populations of American black bears have either been augmented or reintroduced after former extirpation by transplanting bears from elsewhere (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; Reintroductions into Arkansas during the 1960s were highly successful (Smith <em>et al. </em>1991).&#160; Licensed hunters in this state now harvest several hundred bears annually, and bears from Arkansas have expanded into neighboring states. Further reintroductions within Arkansas have been conducted more recently (Wear <em>et al. </em>2005). A successful reintroduction augmented a newly-spawning population in Kentucky (Unger <em>et al. </em>2013). Augmentation of several populations in Louisiana during the mid-1960s likely contributed to population recovery there.<br/> <br/> The Louisiana black bear (<em>U. a. luteolus</em>), a recognized subspecies of American black bear, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992 as a result of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality (Bowker and Jacobson 1995).&#160;At the time of the listing, and since then, the validity and integrity of this subspecies has been debated (Pelton 1991, Kennedy <em>et al</em>. 2002, Csiki <em>et al. </em>2003, Puckett <em>et al. </em>2015). Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from east Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected.&#160;Much of the bottomland hardwood forest that the Louisiana black bear historically inhabited had been converted to agriculture.&#160;Since 1992, remnant bottomland hardwoods have been protected, and some marginal farmland converted to hardwood trees.&#160; Moreover, a new population of bears within Louisiana was established by translocating bears from other Louisiana populations (Benson and Chamberlain 2007) in order to create a stepping-stone between two separated populations; this enabled bears to travel between them (Laufenberg and Clark 2014).&#160;One irony is that the stepping-stone successfully linked a population that was believed to be native Louisiana black bears with a population that had previously been established by translocating <em>U. a. americanus</em> bears from Minnesota (1964â1967). The Minnesota bears had clearly adapted to the very different habitat and weather conditions in Louisiana, as they have been established there for three generations and their numbers have been increasing.&#160;However, if the <em>luteolus</em> subspecies has any merit, the successful establishment of a conservation corridor reduced the purity of that genetic stock.<br/> <br/> The conservation efforts in Louisiana have been further enhanced through public information and education.&#160;This management program is organized by a broad coalition of state and federal agencies, conservation groups, forestry and agricultural industries, and private landowners.&#160;As a result, bears have been noticeably increasing in numbers and distribution in all three range states, although a breeding population does not yet exist in east Texas.&#160; Large, contiguous forested habitat capable of sustaining a population of black bears exists within the historical range of the subspecies in east Texas (Kaminski <em>et al. </em>2013); however, surveys of local people indicate concern over potential conflicts with an established bear population in the area (Morzillo <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the Louisiana black bear, based largely on a rigorous study (Laufenberg and Clark 2014) that showed that all of the population criteria for recovery had been attained and adequate safeguards against future threats were in place (Fuller 2015).<br/> <br/> Another typically-accepted subspecies of black bear (<em>U. a. floridanus</em>) was listed as threatened by the state of Florida in 1974, although legal hunting continued in some population strongholds until 1994.&#160;Habitat degradation, and bears being killed on highways and in conflicts with people are the primary threats to these bears. The fragmented habitat contributes to the high vehicle kills and human interactions. A public petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the Florida black bear as a federally threatened species was denied in 1992.&#160;A black bear management plan, adopted in 1993, directed the state management agency to conserve habitat and reduce human-caused bear mortalities. These efforts, particularly habitat conservation measures and changes in human attitudes toward bears, supported a steady population increase (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;Florida black bears have been expanding into areas of unoccupied habitat as regrowth of understory and forests improve habitat quality, even as development reduces habitat quantity.&#160; In 2010 the status of the Florida black bear was re-evaluated using IUCN redlisting criteria, and after a thorough, peer-reviewed biological assessment and development of a management plan, the species was removed from the stateâs threatened species list in 2012 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;A hunt was initiated in 2015.<br/> <br/> In British Columbia much conservation attention has been directed toward the Kermode subspecies <em>(U. a. kermodei</em>).&#160;This animal is commonly referred to as the âspirit bearâ because it possesses a gene that when homozygous is manifested as white pelage (Ritland <em>et al. 2</em>001).&#160; White-phased animals have long been protected from hunting.&#160; A large system of protected areas was established in 2006 (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) to ban or severely restrict logging within &gt;200,000 ha of coastal temperate rainforest inhabited by this subspecies of black bear, as well as by brown bears.&#160; Additionally, the spirit bear was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia.<br/> <br/> Since 1992 all American black bears have been listed in Appendix II of CITES, under the similarity of appearance provision (Article II, para 2b).&#160; This listing stipulates that documentation of legal harvest is necessary for the import and export of body parts in order to prevent these from being confused as parts from illegally obtained bears.&#160; This listing was not designed to protect American black bears, but rather other species of threatened bears, particularly the Asiatic black bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), whose parts might otherwise be sold under the guise of being from American black bear.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

They are most abundant near water courses in early to mid-seral stages vegetated by a tangle of secondary growth tree species, shrubs and forbs, and containing debris left from earlier forests (Carraway and Verts 1993). It prefers damp soils, digging networks of tunnels along stream banks. Tunnels generally are just below the ground surface, usually on north slopes in California, and on south slopes in British Columbia. It is primarily fossorial but can climb trees and swims well (but not arboreal or aquatic), and stays mostly underground in winter. Oval nests are constructed with leaves, twigs and grasses in a chamber that may be about two feet below the surface of the ground.<br/><br/><em>Aplodontia rufa nigra</em> occurs only in sheltered gulches, steep north facing slopes, and in a few old dune systems, where it requires soil conditions that allow easy excavation and abundant succulent plant food. <em>Aplodontia rufa phaea</em> requires north-facing slopes with dense thickets of brush typically composed of coyote brush, sword fern, blackberry, and poison oak. Openings within Bishop pine forest with dense herbaceous understorey of sword fern and blackberries are also occupied (Carraway and Verts 1999).<br/><br/>Mountain Beavers feed on a wide variety of vegetation. They consume ferns, forbs, and deciduous plants in summer and conifer foliage in fall/winter if other plants are unavailable (Banfield 1974). It forages mainly above the ground (Epple <em>et al.</em> 1993). They require free surface water or succulent vegetation on a daily basis and caches grasses and forbs for winter food. They are active during winter. Throughout the 24-hour day in summer, five to seven periods of activity alternate with periods of rest. They are more active at night than during daylight hours.<br/><br/>Mountain Beavers have a low rate of reproduction and are monoestrous. Gestation lasts 28-30 days. One litter of two to four altricial young are born March-April, sometimes as late as early May in the north. Young are weaned in about six to eight weeks. Females are sexually mature in about two years; yearling females may ovulate but do not breed (Carraway and Verts 1993). A few live up to five to six years. They are usually solitary but may live in loose colonies. Population density estimates generally range from four to eight per hectare, but up to 15-20 per ha (Carraway and Verts 1993). The home range of ten adults radio tracked for three to 19 months was 0.03-0.20 ha, with a mean of 0.12 ha (Carraway and Verts 1993). Significant predators of Mountain Beavers include Coyote and Bobcat.","This species is common and considered a pest throughout much of its range in coastal areas of Northern California, Oregon, Washington and southern British Columbia.

Also around lakes, ponds, marshes, bogs, and other lentic habitats. Though normally associated with water, water shrews ""have been found more than 100 m (328 ft) from streams in mature northern hardwood stands in northern New Hampshire"" (DeGraaf and Rudis 1986). This and other captures far from water probably represent dispersing individuals. <br/><br/>Nest sites are near water in underground burrows, rafted logs, beaver lodges, and other areas providing shelter. <br/>It breeds from February to August in Montana (Conaway 1952). Gestation lasts probably 3 weeks. Litter size is 3-10, average 6; with 2-3 litters/year (Montana). Optimum conditions in captivity, or abundant food supply in nature, may increase the number of litters (Churchfield 1992). They sexually mature in their second calendar year. Their maximum lifespan is about 18 months (Beneski and Stinson 1987).<br/><br/>Common predators include fishes such as trout, bass, and pickerel, minks, otters, weasels, snakes, and occasionally, hawks and owls (Merritt 1987). The water shrew is primarily dependent upon aquatic insects; but also eats various other invertebrates. It may take small vertebrates (fishes, amphibians) when available. It hunts under and on top of water, and may even be seen running across the water surface. Water shrews, with their high metabolic rates, need to consume approximately their weight in food every day (Conaway 1952, Sorenson 1962). In the wild they seem unable to store significant body fat and can die of starvation within a few hours. When a surplus of food is available, it is often horded, the shrew sometimes defecating on it to keep other shrews away.","Churchfield (1992) stated that water shrews (both <em>S. palustris and <em>Neomys sp.</em>) ""</em>are particularly vulnerable to the destruction of their aquatic habitats through pollution and drainage."" Activities such as logging, agriculture, road building, and surface mining contribute to the loss of habitat. Logging may not be a serious threat if water quality is protected and buffer strips are maintained at the site (Christian pers. comm., 1994). <br/><br/>Regarding the subspecies S. p. punctulatus in the east, Pagels <em>et al</em>. (1991) stated: ""Perhaps the greatest continuing threats to the water shrew are the loss of additional habitat resulting from infestation of introduced insect species, such as the gypsy moth, or the use of insecticides to control such infestations. The effects of acid rain, particularly on the shrew's microhabitat and food supply could be particularly devastating"".Shrews feeding on invertebrates accumulate and concentrate pesticides and heavy metals in their tissues. Northern short-tailed shrews (<em>Blarina brevicauda</em>) were found to contain DDT nine years after application of the pesticide to a forest habitat (Dimond and Sherburne 1969). ""Contamination of habitats, and the resultant effects on the food chain, by mining and refining of metalliferous ores, by motor exhausts and even by the application of sewage sludge to land, is becoming more widespread. Shrews from contaminated grasslands have been found to accumulate some of the highest concentrations of metals recorded in wildlife"" (Churchfield 1992). <br/><br/>Southern populations are limited to the mountains in both the east and west and consequently tend to be isolated. When an isolated population disappears for any reason, it is unlikely to be restored by natural dispersal. Hence these isolated populations may be especially vulnerable to extirpation from human activities or long-term climate change.","This species has a large range in the boreal and montane regions of North America, and its population is secure, if not abundant, throughout the northern part of the range; in the south, its habitat has been fragmented since the retreat of the last glaciers, making isolated populations vulnerable to extirpation; some subspecies are rare enough to be of concern.<br/><br/>Information on population density is limited. Population densities in the Appalachians appear to be quite low, though numbers are not available (Pagels&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1991). In Canada, Banfield (1974) reported that this shrew is usually uncommon but sizeable populations sometimes occur in favourable locations.

A small, disjunct population in Arizona's White Mountains has not been observed in recent years (Hoffmeister 1986); there is another apparently disjunct series of populations in the Appalachians ranges from southwestern Pennsylvania to North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia.<br/><br/>Pagels (1990, 1991) noted that in the southern Appalachians the water shrew is limited to prime habitat: ""high elevation situations where moist, cool, shaded situations have prevailed throughout historic timeâ¦elevations ranging from about 760 m (2,500 ft.) in Pennsylvania to 1,150 m (3,800 ft.) and above in North Carolina and Tennessee.""",,Terrestrial,"The water shrew is a boreal species, also inhabiting relict habitat in southern mountains.

As <em>A. flavidus</em> utilizes this kelp species for reproductive purposes, populations may be in decline in areas where kelp is impacted by development. Further research both on the dependency of <em>A. flavidus </em>&#160;on the presence of <em>M. pyrifera</em> and on the state of <em>M. pyrifera</em> populations is needed. Males, like other Gasterosteiforme fishes, actively defend nest sites (Limbaugh 1962).<br/><br/><em></em><em>Aulorhynchus flavidus</em> primarily eats small crustaceans and fish larvae (Hart 1973), and is fed on by several species of bass (<em>Paralabrax</em> spp.), scorpionfish (<em>Scorpaena guttata</em>), cabezon (<em>Scorpaenichthys marmoratus</em>), and other groundfish (Limbaugh 1962).<br/><br/>Very little is known about adult movement patterns in this species. Storm-induced drift is considered a factor in dispersal, as dislodged egg masses are transported by currents to new locations (Marliave 1976).&#160;<em>A. flavidus</em> is known to school up in groups, some of which have been recorded to number in the thousands (Limbaugh 1962, Marliave 1976).<br/><em>A. flavidus</em> has been documented to be infected by myxosporean parasites, however no detrimental histological reaction has been documented. The species is thought to act as a reservoir for the parasite near salmon net-pens (Shaw <em>et al. </em>1997)<em>.</em>","Although <em>A. flavidus</em> is collected for the aquarium trade, it is not suspected to be at a level to cause conservation concern. Coastal development and sedimentation that impact kelp may indirectly affect wild populations of the species.","While no directed population studies of <em>A. flavidus</em> have been undertaken, the species is widespread and common. &#160;These fish were reported in 17.4% of dives between 1997 and 2011 by The Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) citizen science program, with an annual average of about 8-10 individuals seen per dive in Monterey Bay (Wolfe and Pattengill-Semmens 2013). Thedinga <em>et al.</em> (2011) found that <em>A. flavidus</em> was present in at least 67% of beach seine samples in Prince William Sound as late as 2007, while Garwood <em>et al.</em> (2013) report similar numbers for eelgrass trawls in northern California.",Unknown,"<em>Aulorhynchus flavidus</em> occurs on the west coast of North America from Prince William Sound, Alaska, to Rompiente, Baja California.","<em>Aulorhynchus flavidus</em> is a common aquarium species for public display, however harvest levels have not been formally evaluated.

S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, J. M. Lammertink <em>in litt.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>.&#160;It occurs from sea-level to 1,200 m in the northern part of its range, and to 2,700 m in the southern part. Nests are generally in trees within closed-canopy forest, (usually in cavities or on stick platforms constructed originally by raptors, wood rats or squirrels), in caves, or on cliff-ledges in steep-walled canyons. Eggs are laid from March to May. Young birds disperse, as too may unpaired birds or those that have failed to breed previously (Forsman <em>et al. </em>2002,&#160;Blakesley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014a)<strong></strong> and this may help to sustain some sink populations. It may make some movements in winter, including to recently burnt areas as these can have greater food availability (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b). It feeds principally on nocturnal mammals.<p></p>","Degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through clear felling and selective logging is the primary threat to the species; with habitat fragmentation shown to correlate with decreased probability of survival (Schilling <em>et al. </em>2013). This has been compounded by the removal of a requirement that contractors assess the viability of wildlife on U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service lands (Noon and Blakesley 2006)<strong></strong>. Populations in the&#160;southwest of its range, California, and dry inland forests of the Pacific Northwest&#160;are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by fire and drought associated with climate change  (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011, Jones <em>et al. </em>2016, T. Supplee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, R. GutiÃ©rrez&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016), although there has been a suggestion that the species may persist with a degree of habitat burning (see&#160;Roberts <em>et al. </em>2011, Lee <em>et al. </em>2012, Willey and van Riper III 2014). Habitat loss to wildfire has been greater than expected in recent years, raising the economic value of remaining habitat (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Projected climate change may result in hotter and drier summers with longer fire seasons and larger more intense fires, as well as increased tree mortality from drought and insects, and uncertainty over the viability of habitat restoration. Further effects from climate change may affect different areas differently (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011) and could include changes in the frequency and duration of inclement weather during the breeding season (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012); and in the Pacific northwest it may lead to wetter and warmer winters (Glenn <em>et al. </em>2010). Timber harvesting on private land is a significant threat, as well as renewed pressure to eliminate protections for the species on federal land in Oregon, in order to allow increased logging (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, R. GutiÃ©rrez&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unfavourable management includes intensive thinning of suitable habitat,  which is expected to result in declines over the short term (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), as well as logging and manipulation of canopy vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire (B. Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may also face high levels of disturbance, especially in recreational areas where it occurs such as National Parks (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). It faces strong competition from Barred Owl <em>Strix varia</em> which is gradually displacing Spotted Owls from much of the northern part of their range, outcompeting Spotted Owls for food and space and occasionally hybridising (Kelly and Forsman 2004, Dugger <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. While <em>S. varia </em>is not known to have affected the population trend in California yet, some hybrids have been noted there and it does appear to be spreading into the range of California Spotted Owl (Tempel <em>et al. </em>2014a, R. GutiÃ©rrez&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Energy development and associated habitat loss and mortalities from collisions with powerlines could also be affecting this species, but the degree of impact is essentially unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Potentially serious threats include West Nile virus, which is fatal to the species (although it may be absent from some subpopulations [Hull <em>et al. </em>2010]), the potential loss of habitat to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome  (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), and avian malaria, which has been discovered in the species and found to weaken infected individuals, probably reducing reproductive success (Ishak<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Other potential threats have been put forward, for instance it has been mooted that water management could possibly have an impact on the species through indirect effects, though these will require further study (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012).<br/><p></p>","Its population size is estimated at c.15,000 mature individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004). <p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Strix occidentalis</em> has five subspecies: <em>caurina</em>&#160;('Northern Spotted Owl') has a minimum of 3,778 pairs and 1,001 territorial individuals from south-west British Columbia, <strong>Canada</strong>, to north California, <strong>USA</strong>; the nominate ('California Spotted Owl') has a minimum of 3,050 individuals in central and south California, USA, and (formerly) Baja California, Mexico; and&#160;<em>lucida</em>,&#160;<em>juanaphillipsae </em>and <em>huachucae </em>('Mexican Spotted Owl')&#160;(see del Hoyo and Collar 2014).&#160;Subspecies <em>huachuacae </em>occurs&#160;from Utah and Colorado to Arizona, New Mexico and extreme west Texas, USA, while <em>lucida</em>&#160;occurs in Sonora, Chihuahua and Nuevo LeÃ³n to Jalisco, Durango, MichoacÃ¡n and Guanajuanto, <strong>Mexico</strong> (Johnsgard 1988a, Sibley and Monroe 1990, GutiÃ©rrez <em>et al</em> 1995, Lammertink <em>et al.</em> 1996,  AOU 1998, del Hoyo and Collar&#160;2014), and <em>juanaphillipsae</em> has been recently described from the State of Mexico (Dickerman 1997)<strong></strong>.

In 2012 9.6 million acres of habitat was designated as critical habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl by U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Society for Conservation Biology 2012).

Neither have so far had much success (Moore, 2013). Experimental removal of Barred Owls has been proposed and is underway (Oregon Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S.

Large reserves, encompassing suitable habitat and widely distributed are needed to retain the owl's current range. Calls have been made for captive breeding of birds from the tiny remaining British Columbian population. To prevent local extinction a halt to logging operations is required in parts of its range.

It has become extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the USA, and their present distribution is more restricted; wolves occur primarily but not exclusively in wilderness and remote areas. Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third by deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock and fear of attacks on humans. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, rural human population shifts to cities and increasing prey populations have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of its range and reintroduction in three areas of USA. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock and game species, exaggerated concern by the public regarding the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with long-term viability.<br/><br/>Although the Grey Wolf still faces some threats, its relatively widespread range and stable population trend mean that the species, at global level, does not meet, or nearly meet, any of the criteria for the threatened categories. The global population is estimated to be in the order of 200-250 thousands individuals.&#160;Therefore, it is assessed as Least Concern.

Wolves will also eat smaller prey items, livestock, carrion, and garbage.","The historical range of the Grey Wolf has been reduced by about one-third, primarily in developed areas of Europe, Asia, Mexico, and the United States by poisoning and deliberate persecution due to depredation on livestock. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of Western Europe and the United States, and reintroduction in the western United States and Mexico. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock, especially in developing countries, exaggerated concern by the public concerning the threat and danger of wolves. Fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with long-term viability can be a threat in parts of the range with highest density of human activities.","Because of the diversity in climate, topography, vegetation, human settlement and development of wolf range, wolf populations in various parts of the original range vary from extinct to relatively pristine.

For Europe, the wolf population is essentially a large meta-population with several distinct subpopulations; the status and trends for each population is provided by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (<a href=""http://www.lcie.org/"">http://www.lcie.org/</a>) and in Chapron <em>et al</em>.

Their present distribution is more restricted: wolves occur primarily in wilderness and remote areas, especially in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75Â°N to 12Â°N (Mech and Boitani 2004), but they are found also in human-dominated landscapes where there is sufficient prey base and human-caused mortality is low.

It has apparently been introduced into Australia and North America where it is now widespread and may be invasive. However, it is difficult to interpret information on the distribution of this species with any confidence due to taxonomic confusion. Thus, according to (StevanoviÄ 1999) the only&#160;<em>Trapa</em>&#160;species occurring in Serbia was&#160;<em>T. annosa</em>, but&#160;<em>T. natans</em>&#160;is widely reported in the literature as occurring in Serbia - the different statements almost certainly refer to the same taxon but only in a few cases is it possible to establish which taxa are intended.<br/><br/>With reference to the historic distribution of&#160;<em>T. natans</em>&#160;and its relationship with man, there is wide speculation that its range was strongly influenced by its value as a crop. Arber (1920) states that&#160;<em>T. natans</em> has been used from early times for food, medicine and magic, and is supposed to have been introduced into Switzerland as long ago as the period of the lake dwellings, while Vankina (1970) goes further to say that ""During the Atlantic and sub-boreal periods the area of distribution of&#160;<em>T. natans</em>&#160;stretched as far north as Middle Sweden and southern Finland. In Latvia, it appeared in the warm Atlantic period and has been found here at a total of 13 sites, including in the cultural layers of six settlement sites. At SÄrnate, it has been found in dense layers of nutshells up to 40 cm thick around the hearths, occupying areas of several square metres. It has been suggested that the people of the Stone Age deliberately cultivated the water chestnut near their settlements. There is evidence that in the 16<sup>th</sup>&#160;century roasted water chestnuts or water chestnut flour were sold in the markets of Mantua and Ferrara. At the beginning of the same century, in southern France the water chestnut was consumed raw, boiled or roasted, and also used in the form of flour. It is known that during the time of the First World War the water chestnut was also sold at the market in the Latvian town of JÄkabpils. At around 900 BC, evidently as a result of climatic cooling, the water chestnut began to die out.""<em></em>","The fruits are important in continental Asia, Malaysia, India and especially in China. Several countries in southeast Asia and also Chinese communities in Europe and North America import the fruit directly from China. It is widely cultivated across the region. Fruits are used in the preparation of liniments to treat elephantiasis, pestilent fevers, rheumatism, sores, sunburn and skin complaints. It is also used as food for pigs and other livestock in southeast Asia. <br/><br/>In India, the kernel of the plant is used as a laxative and is a good source of nutritious flour.

121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the worldâs most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, FrkoviÄ <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5â15 bears per 1,000 kmÂ²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, FrkoviÄ <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130â220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 kmÂ² and 2,200 kmÂ² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21â29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of GÃ¤rdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (â1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 kmÂ² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 kmÂ² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species has low biological productivity with small litters and a biennial reproductive cycle. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for its meat as well as fins. The population appeared to be stable at relatively high levels of abundance during the 1990s and early 2000s. Since cessation of an open ocean gillnet fishery in the early 1990s, the population may be rebuilding. There is no information available on population trends since that time, except an anecdotal note by recreational fishers of a decline in catch in Prince William Sound, Alaska that resulted in a self-imposed avoidance of this species. Other than this noted decline in Alaska, there is nothing to infer population decline and thus, the species is assessed as Least Concern. Improved catch monitoring, analysis of the population trend analysis, and precautionary fishing limits are recommended.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","The Salmon Shark occurs in sub-Arctic and temperate nearshore and oceanic waters to depths of 1,864 m, though generally they range down to 300 m (Goldman and Musick 2008, Carlisle <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It reaches a maximum size of 305 cm total length (TL) (Goldman and Musick 2006), males mature at 180â240 cm TL, and females mature at 195â250 cm TL (Goldman 2002, Goldman and Musick 2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and oophagous with litter sizes of 2â5, a gestation period of 8â9 months, a biennial reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 65â80 cm TL (Tanaka 1980, Nagasawa 1998, Goldman and Musick 2006, Goldman and Musick 2008, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Conrath <em>et al. </em>2014). There is regional variation in age estimates between the Northeast and Northwest Pacific; female age-at-maturity is 6â9 and 8â10 years, observed maximum age for females is 20 and 17 years; and, generation length is therefore 13.8 and 13.0 years in the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Pacific, respectively (Tanaka 1980, Goldman 2002). Males in the Northwest Pacific were observed to 25 years of age and longevity is estimated as 20â30 years in both the Northeast and Northwest Pacific (Goldman and Musick 2008). The Salmon Shark has a moderate annual rate of population increase for the Northeast Pacific of 0.081, which is similar to that of the North Atlantic congener Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2008).","<p>The Salmon Shark is primarily taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries operating in offshore and high-seas waters (Goldman and Musick 2008, Murua <em>et al. </em>2013). It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as by rod and reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Salmon Shark was historically taken in the 1950s and 1960s in relatively large numbers (105,000â155,000 individuals per year) in open ocean gillnet fisheries that ceased operating in the early 1990s (Goldman and Musick 2008). <br/></p>  <p>Salmon Sharks are sometimes retained for their meat and fins (CardeÃ±osa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Fields&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018)<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is currently targeted by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality.

The Salmon Shark was historically taken in the 1950s and 1960s in relatively large numbers, but since those fisheries ceased in the 1990s, it appears fishing mortality of Salmon Shark in the open ocean has reduced and the population could be rebuilding (Goldman and Musick 2008). Based on landings data in Japan, the population of Salmon Sharks was considered stable in the Northwest Pacific from 1985 to 1995 (Nagasawa 1998). Demographic analysis indicated that in the early 2000s, the population of Salmon Shark was stable across the Northeast and Northwest Pacific, but that Salmon Sharks are vulnerable to fishing mortality (Goldman 2002). Anecdotal information by recreational fishers notes a decline in recreational catch during 2009â2010 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, but no further information is available (Orion Charters 2017).

130482064,2475,Balaenoptera borealis,Endangered,A1abd,2018,2018-06-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Sei Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible and is understood and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The three-generation time period for applying criterion A is 70 years. Following the end of large-scale whaling in the late 1970s, some recovery of the population is inferred based on standard assumptions about the population dynamics. Recent abundance estimates for Sei Whales from the North Pacific are consistent with the inferred rate of recovery. There is little direct evidence of recovery in the Southern Hemisphere where the greatest declines occurred, but there has also been little monitoring effort there, and the recovery predicted by the population model is assumed. The species has been listed as Endangered, but plausible projections of the population size indicate that the global population of&#160;mature animals&#160;may have recovered to around 30% of the 1948 level by 2018. The corresponding extent of reduction, at 70%, is at the borderline between Endangered and Vulnerable under criterion A1. In view of the Red List rule that taxa should remain in a higher category of threat for five years after ceasing to meet the criteria for that category, the species remains classified as Endangered, but should be re-evaluated in five years, at which time it can be reclassified to Vulnerable unless new data cast doubt on the predicted recovery.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Sei Whales exhibit a greater variety in diet than some other large whales such as Blue Whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), but tend to feed on only one type of prey at a time. Whale stomachs examined in the northeastern Atlantic contained copepods and euphausiids (JonsgÃ¥rd and Darling 1977). Of 21,713 stomachs examined from pelagic catches in the North Pacific during 1952-71, 82.7% contained copepods only and 12.6% contained euphausiids only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977). Sei Whale stomachs analysed in the eastern North Pacific off California contained euphausiids and anchovies (Rice 1977) and off British Colombia they fed primarily on copepods in some years and euphausiids or fish in other years (Flinn <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stomachs of Sei Whales taken by Soviet operations in the western North Pacific included copepods and euphausiids, as well as Anchovy, Sardine, Saury, Walleye Pollock, Mackerel, Capelin, and squid (Shuntov and Ivanov 2015). Some of these prey items plus euphausiids were also found in stomachs of Sei Whales taken in Japanese operations in the northwest Pacific in 2009 (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Of 31,494 stomachs examined in the Southern Hemisphere during 1961-66, 54.3% contained euphausiids only, 30.5% contained copepods only, and 14.4% contained amphipods only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977).<br/><br/>Studies have shown a clear differentiation between Sei Whale and Brydeâs Whale habitats in the western North Pacific, where each species favoured different ranges in sea surface temperatures and related covariates, Sei Whales being found in areas with lower sea surface temperatures (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2013, Murase <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, in other parts of the world Sei and Brydes Whales have been found to be sympatric in the same season (Gallardo <em>et al</em>. 1983).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Sei Whale exploitation by modern whaling was particularly intensive in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, following the depletion of Blue, Fin (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and Humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) Whales. Sei Whale stocks were seriously depleted during this period. Exploitation in the North Atlantic occurred over a longer period and was less intensive, except in the eastern North Atlantic, where the population appears not to have recovered from early modern whaling. Commercial exploitation ceased in the North Pacific in 1975, in the Southern Hemisphere in 1979 and in the North Atlantic in 1989 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catches by Japan under scientific permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2002. From 2004-2013, the annual take was 100 animals and was increased to 134 per year from 2017. The IWC Scientific Committee has advised that this level of take will not harm the stock (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>There are records of ship strikes and entanglements involving Sei Whales (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Henry <em>et al.</em> 2014), but it is unclear whether they constitute a significant source of mortality. Because of the Sei Whaleâs offshore distribution, most ship strikes could go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Rice (1961, 1974) reported a pathological condition in several North Pacific Sei Whales that resulted in deterioration or loss of baleen; however, the current frequency of this condition, and its impact (if any) on the population, are unknown.<br/><br/>An unusual mass mortality of at least 343 Sei Whales that occurred in southern Chile in March 2015 is still under investigation but may have been caused by a harmful algal bloom associated with a developing El NiÃ±o event, the frequency of which can be expected to increase as the Pacific Ocean warms (HÃ¤ussermann<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes three stock divisions for Sei Whales in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia (including the waters off the east coast of the U.S.A.); Iceland-Denmark Strait; and Eastern (including the waters of Spain, Portugal, British Isles, Faroes, and Norway), but the divisions were chosen on largely arbitrary grounds (Donovan 1991). The West-Greenland-Labrador Sea area is not assigned to a stock division, but Sei Whales are present there. Genetic comparisons of Sei Whales from different North Atlantic locations found no evidence for population structure but did not rule it out (Huijser <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>About 17,000 Sei Whales were recorded caught by modern whaling in the North Atlantic (Allison 2017). In addition, a proportion of the approximately 13,000 unspecified large whales caught in the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would have been Sei Whales, given that the specified catch in the same areas in the following years included Sei Whales. Sei Whales appear to have been depleted in the eastern North Atlantic, with nearly 10,000 recorded taken in Norwegian and British waters prior to 1940 (not counting unspecified whales), but fewer than 250 since then. The species seems to be virtually absent there now: Norwegian surveys of northeast Atlantic waters in 1987, 1989, and annually from 1995â2009 have yielded only two Sei Whale sightings (NAMMCO 2010).<br/> <br/> A summer 2007 survey of the European Atlantic (an area west of British Isles, and Biscaya, northwestern Spain) yielded an estimate of 366 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.33) Sei Whales (Macleod <em>et al</em>. 2009). No Sei Whales were seen in surveys on the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, Sei Whales are still abundant in the central North Atlantic (Iceland-Denmark Strait IWC stock area), especially southwest of Iceland south to 50Â°N in summer. The only survey with reasonably complete coverage and designed specifically for the purpose of estimating Sei Whale abundance was in 1989, and yielded a population estimate of 10,300 (CV 0.27) (Cattanach <em>et al</em>. 1993). Areas of Sei Whale summer abundance seem to shift markedly between years, more so than for other baleen whale species (Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Sei Whales were among the most commonly sighted whales in a 2004 summer survey in the mid-Atlantic Ridge region, with a total of 53 sightings (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008). The 2007 Trans-NASS survey yielded an estimate of ~5,000 (CV ~0.5) Sei Whales but covered a smaller area than the 1989 survey (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2010). Surveys of U.S. and southern Nova Scotian waters during 2010-14 yielded an estimate of 919 (CV 0.31) Sei Whales averaged (with inverse variance weighting) over spring, summer, and fall, or 849 (CV 0.42) whales in summer only (Palka <em>et al</em>. 2017). These estimates are similar to the estimate of 870 Sei Whales obtained by Chapman and Mitchell (1977) from data collected in this area during 1966-69. About 1,200 Sei Whales were taken off Nova Scotia during 1962â72. Surveys of Atlantic Canadian waters in 2007 yielded just two Sei Whale sightings, too few to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Chapman and Mitchell (1977) estimated the abundance in the Labrador Sea-West Greenland area at 965.&#160; <br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>The last stock assessment of North Pacific Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was in 1974 (IWC 1977). The âexploitableâ population (animals of legally catchable size) was estimated to have declined from 42,000 in 1963 to 8,600 in 1974 (Tillman 1977). Over 40,000 Sei Whales were caught during this period, out of a total of about 70,000 taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century (Allison 2017). A 75% reduction in Sei Whale catch rates at California whaling stations during the 1960s is consistent with an ocean-wide decline (Rice 1977).<br/><br/>From sighting surveys conducted under the IWC POWER programme in July and August 2010-2012, Hakamada <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated 29,632 (CV 0.24) Sei Whales in the area east of 170Â°E. To this can be added an estimate of 5,086 (CV 0.38) obtained from national surveys west of 170Â°E in the same months in 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016), giving a total of about 35,000 Sei Whales.<br/> <br/> Assuming that the population was about 50% âexploitableâ when commercial whaling ceased in 1975, the recent abundance estimate (2008-12, see above) would correspond roughly to a doubling of the population over the 35-year intervening period, representing a recovery rate of about 2% per year. Thus, the older and newer abundance estimates appear to be broadly compatible (see Supplementary Materials), but the relatively simple analysis of catch and whaling effort data by Tillman (1977) is no longer an accepted method to obtain abundance estimates.<br/> <br/> Sei Whales appear to have been reasonably common in the eastern North Pacific, with over 2,800 taken off Vancouver Island, Canada between 1948 and 1967 (Allison 2017) and 384 whales taken by Californian whalers between 1958 and 1971 (Rice 1977). The estimated abundance for the U.S. west coast was only 56 whales from surveys in 1996 and 2001 (Barlow 2003), but this has increased to 519 whales (CV 0.40) from surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>The IWC arbitrarily divides Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales, along with other Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, into six longitudinally defined management areas. Sei Whales in all six areas have been classified as Protection Stocks by the IWC since 1978. Over 200,000 Sei Whales were recorded taken by modern whaling in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905â1979. The largest catches were during 1960â72, when they exceeded 5,000 in every year, and exceeded 20,000 in each of the 1964/65 and 1965/66 seasons. Most catches were taken in summer by pelagic fleets operating south of 40Â°S, but winter catches were also taken from land stations in Brazil, Chile, and South Africa (Allison 2017). The catches by the former Soviet Union were grossly underreported at the time: 33,000 Sei Whales were reported taken during 1950-78, but subsequently records totalling nearly 60,000 were found and are included in the above figures (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The last assessment of Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was conducted in 1979 (IWC 1980). Some extra information on these assessments is given by Horwood (1987). Based on catches/sightings per unit effort from Japanese catch and scouting vessels, the âexploitableâ stock size (whales of legal size, approximately 2/3 of total population), excluding Area II (South Atlantic sector), was estimated to have declined from about 64,000 in 1960 to about 11,000 by 1979. The population assessment method failed to produce an estimate for Area II, because nearly all the catch for this area was taken in just two seasons (1964/65 and 1965/66), yet the abundance indices suggested a more continuous decline during the 1960s and 1970s (IWC 1980). This suggests that whales move between management areas, and that these areas do not correspond to demographically distinct populations.<br/> <br/> Other available evidence also suggests a severe and rapid decline in Sei Whale stocks during the 1960s and 1970s. The catch and sighting rates from winter whaling operations off Brazil and South Africa show very sharp declines. Abundance indices from the Brazilian whaling ground for Sei Whales during 1966â81 (da Rocha 1983) declined by about 90% during 1966â72. Catch and sightings indices off Durban, South Africa for 1965â74 (Best 1976) declined by over 95%. Tag-recapture data from pelagic whaling suggested an approximately six-fold decline between 1962 and 1976 (IWC 1980).<br/> <br/> IWC (1996) gives a total population estimate for Sei Whales south of 30Â°S in summer of about 10,000 in 1983 based on a combination of International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Japanese Scouting Vessel (JSV) sightings data. It is difficult to know how much reliance to place on this estimate because no variance is given, but it is consistent with a severe decline. No more recent data covering a wide area are available, except for the area south of 60Â°S, which is outside the main range of Sei Whales. In the absence of dedicated surveys in Sei Whale habitat, and corresponding abundance estimates, it is not possible to verify whether there has been any increase in Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales since the cessation of whaling.<br/> <br/> Because of the erratic local appearance of Sei Whales, recovery is hard to detect from observations collected in limited areas. No recovery of Sei Whales in Brazilian waters has been detected since their depletion (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997, Andriolo <em>et al</em>. 2010), but IÃ±Ã­guez <em>et al. </em>(2010) reported on a possible slow recovery of Sei Whales in the southwestern Atlantic based on land and aerial sightings in Argentina. <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Generation time and maximum rate of increase</strong></em><em></em><br/>The generation time for Sei Whales is estimated to be 23.3 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The three-generation time window for applying the IUCN Red List decline criterion A is 1948â2018.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the IWC Scientific Committee has used a natural mortality rate of about 0.06, an age at first reproduction declining with stock depletion from 12-13 years to 10-11 years, and an annual pregnancy rate increasing with stock depletion from 0.27 to 0.37-0.39 (IWC 1977, 1980, Horwood 1980). Assuming a maximum annual pregnancy rate of 0.40, a minimum age of first reproduction of 10 years, and no juvenile mortality, the maximum rate of increase is 2.7% per year. Horwood and Millward (1987) also conclude that the maximum rate of increase for Sei Whale populations is less than 3% per year. Newer data on life history parameters have been collected in the northwestern Pacific during 2004-2015 and are awaiting analysis (IWC 2017).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Population assessment</strong></em><br/>Because the available published assessments for this species are not up to date, an updated population assessment is conducted here to enable assessment of the population reduction over the period 1948-2018 relative to the Red List A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, a conventional population assessment model was used to provide an illustration of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (ârecruitmentâ) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately. Based on the above information, fitted population sizes for the aged 1+ population size were 12,000 in 1989 in the North Atlantic, 35,000 in 2011 in the North Pacific and 10,000 in 1983 in the Southern Hemsiphere.<br/><br/>The results are provided in the Supplementary Materials, which constitute an integral part of this assessment. Results indicate severe depletion from 1948 to a minimum in the 1970s, followed by gradual recovery such that the global population of mature animals in 2018 is predicted to be around 30% of the 1948 level and to be increasing.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Sei Whale is a cosmopolitan species, with a mainly offshore distribution. The species occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere, but there are no confirmed records in the northern Indian Ocean (Rice 1998, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> Sei Whales migrate between tropical and subtropical latitudes in winter and temperate and subpolar latitudes in summer, staying mainly in water temperatures of 8-18Â°C. Their winter distribution seems to be widely dispersed and is not fully mapped (Horwood 1987, 2017). Sei Whale sightings in the tropics and subtropics can be hard to confirm due to difficulty differentiating them from Brydeâs Whales.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution seems to be quite variable from year to year; however, Sei Whales typically occur north of an arc running from south of Nova Scotia in the west, to the northwestern British Isles and Trondheim (Norway) in the east. They occur as far north as the Davis Strait and the northern end of the Denmark Strait, and to about 70Â°N in the Norwegian Sea. Occasional incursions into other areas have been noted (e.g., the Gulf of Maine, Schilling <em>et al</em>. 1993). Peaks of catch rates in early and late summer suggested a northward and southward migration through the former Nova Scotia whaling ground (Mitchell 1975). Sei Whales have been scarce in Norwegian and British waters in recent years despite significant catches there in the past. Sei Whales were caught in limited numbers, mainly in late summer, off northwestern Spain (Aguilar and Sanpera 1982). There are very few records from the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known, but some animals occur off the central eastern seaboard of the U.S.A., and they are occasionally seen in winter as far south as the Caribbean Sea and Cap Blanc, Mauritania (Rice 1998, Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2012). Satellite tagging has shown Sei Whale migration from the Azores to the Labrador Sea and to the Canary Islands (Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Winter catches of Sei Whales in an area north of the Cape Verde Islands by the illegal catcher boats Sierra and Tonna in the late 1970s may indicate wintering grounds there (Best 1992).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale summer distribution is mainly north of 40Â°N, including the offshore North Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They are common only in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea, and have never been recorded in Bering Strait or the Arctic seas. They do not penetrate far into the Okhotsk Sea. Although they are rare in summer south of 40Â°N in the offshore central and eastern North Pacific (IWC 2018a) the presence of some Sei Whales in Hawaiian waters in both summer and fall has been confirmed (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known. Surveys in February-March 1993-95 south from Japan to the Philippines, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands found no Sei Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). However, Sei Whales were caught in winter off the Ogasawara Islands during 1923-49. Although Sei and Brydeâs Whales were not routinely distinguished at the time, Omura and Fujino (1954) found that, of a sample of âSeiâ Whales examined in detail, those caught during November-April were true Sei Whales whereas those caught in May were Brydeâs Whales. Sei Whales were marked around the Northern Mariana Islands and to the northeast in January-February 1972 and some of them were recaptured in summer in the northeastern and northwestern North Pacific (Masaki 1977). Sei Whales were also sighted on a January-April survey of the waters off Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2007 (Fulling <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific during 1986-2003 showed that Sei Whales were probably rare during the months surveyed (July to November) but there were problems distinguishing them from Brydes Whales (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <em><br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em></em><em></em><br/>The summer (JanuaryâFebruary) distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly in the zone 40â55Â°S in the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, and 45â60Â°S in the South Pacific (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), with occasional catches recorded in the high Antarctic (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Sei and Bryde's Whales were distinguished in Peruvian whaling records from 1973; after that date, Sei Whales were caught or seen on the Peruvian grounds (3Â°-9Â°S) mainly, but not exclusively, in the austral winter (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1982, 1984).<br/><br/>Sei and Brydes Whales do not seem to have been distinguished in the records of whaling stations in Chile, because only Sei Whales are featured in their catch and sighting records (Maturana 1981, Allison 2017) but Gallardo <em>et al</em>. (1983) found both Sei and Brydes Whales present in summer (February) in most of the range of Chilean whaling operations (32Â°â38Â°S). Subsequently, Sei Whales have been observed feeding off Chile (~42Â°S) during the summer (Galletti <em>et al</em>. 2005). This species is also regularly observed in the Magellan Strait in summer (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sei Whales are also regularly sighted in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (South Atlantic) with peak occurrence between February and April (Frans and AugÃ© 2016).<br/><br/>Sei Whales were also caught in the austral winter off Costinha, northeastern Brazil (7Â°S) during 1947-77. Sei and Brydes Whales were distinguished only from 1967; after that date, Sei Whales represented about 90% of the catch of the two species combined (Williamson 1975; da Rocha 1983).<br/><br/>The catches of ""Sei"" Whales recorded off Angola, the Congo, Gabon, and countries in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century were probably mainly Bryde's Whales (Weir 2010). Platform-of-opportunity surveys of cetaceans in these waters during 2004-09 resulted in only one Sei Whale sighting out of over 3,000 cetacean sightings, including 88 sightings of Brydes Whales (Weir 2011). Catches off western South Africa (Saldanha Bay) and eastern South Africa (Durban) peaked in spring and autumn, and are suggestive of populations on migration routes (Horwood 1987).

It breeds on maritime and inland grassy slopes, sometimes on predator-free islands, and rarely on steep island or mainland cliffs. It occurs in large aggregations at sea, often forming dense roosting flocks at night in sheltered bays. In winter it is normally pelagic in waters offshore from breeding areas and sometimes in near-shore coastal waters where food is highly concentrated due to oceanographic conditions. <strong>Diet:</strong> It feeds mostly on fish throughout the year supplemented in winter by small amounts of invertebrates such as squid and krill. Chicks are fed almost exclusively on fish, though invertebrates may also be given to late-hatching young. <strong>Breeding:</strong> It arrives at colonies in late March and early April, laying from the end of April to mid-June. It is monogamous with high site and mate fidelity. It is highly colonial in small to very large concentrations (sometimes over 100,000 individuals). Laying is often highly asynchronous within a colony. Birds lay in nest chambers at the end of a burrow which are excavated by both sexes (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1996).","<p>The ongoing decline has been attributed mainly to the ecosystem effects resulting from climate change, including the impact of long-term changes in sea surface temperatures and altered timing and intensity of upwelling (Gaston<em> et al. </em>2009). Interaction with commercial fisheries poses another significant threat. In the 1980s, c. 5,000 birds were annually captured in the salmon gill-net fishery off Japan, with further mortality in gillnets off Washington and British Columbia (Gaston and Dechesne 1996). Predation by non-native species may be contributory to decline in certain parts of the speciesâ range; Arctic Fox <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> have caused population declines in Alaska, on islands where there were introduced for hunting (Gaston and Dechesne 1996), rats<em> Rattus</em> spp. have impacted populations in Russia (Gaston and Dechesne 1996) and raccoons <em>Procyon lotor</em> were introduced to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the early 1940s, with the support of the Provincial Game Commission, and likely caused the extirpation of the colony on Saunders Island and dramatically reduced the population on Helgesen Island (Gaston and Deschesne 1996).

The species breeds from May onwards, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It usually nests solitarily on smaller waters but may nest in loosely colonial groups on larger waters (e.g. several pairs nesting a few metres apart on the same lake) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration, large flocks of 200-1,200 individuals may form, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is most commonly observed singly, in pairs or in small scattered flocks during this season however (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on freshwater pools or lakes in open moorland, blanket bogs or open and wet peatland habitats (Campbell 1987, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It will nest on pools as small as 10-20 m long or on lakes up to 5 ha in area, showing a preference for those in treeless areas that have well-vegetated margins and low islets or promontories on which to nest (Snow and Perrins 1998). It generally avoids waters with dense floating or emergent vegetation and steep rocks above the water, and if feeding conditions are inadequate in the pool chosen for breeding the species may fly to the coast or to lakes with higher abundances of fish in order to feed (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn, aquatic insects, annelid worms and plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small depression or a mound of plant matter, built in shallow water up to 10 m from the shore or very near the water's edge, on islets or small promontories (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).

It generally avoids wooded areas and xeric habitats, with taiga representing a barrier in the north of Eurasia and deserts and arid steppes a barrier in the south.&#160;Breeding occurs from late March or early April to August and September in most of the range. It is monogamous but the female builds the nest alone. It is in an excavated scrape or natural depression on the ground among short vegetation filled with a thick layer of grass and lined with finer vegetation. Clutches are normally three to five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, seeds and other plant material. The diet is seasonal; primarily insectivorous in summer and herbivorous in the winter (Donald and Garcia 2014). The species is predominantly resident but with some short-distance dispersive movement in western and southern Europe and across the southern and eastern limits of the range in Asia. Birds in northern and central Europe and across much of Asia migrate after breeding (Donald and Garcia 2014).","The main cause of decline in this species is agricultural intensification. Recent research indicates the principal causes are changes in management of cereal-growing and grassland (leading to reduced nesting and foraging opportunities, and diminution of food resources (Donald and Garcia 2014). In grasslands high fertiliser applications lead to vegetation that is too tall and dense for nesting. The heavy use of pesticides and herbicides is thought to negatively impact this species too (Tucker and Heath 1994). High hunting pressure in some countries poses an additional threat (Donald and Garcia 2014).","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number&#160;44,300,000-78,800,000 pairs, which equates to 88,700,000-158,000,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife   International 2015).

It breeds from April or May (later in northern populations) (Kear 2005), in single pairs or colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), on islands or small islets, adults often assembling in groups on beaches when not at the nest (even when nesting solitarily) (Kear 2005). Males leave the breeding grounds in June to moult in small groups along the coast (Scott and Rose 1996), often considerable distances from the breeding areas (Snow and Perrins 1998) (although there is no evidence for any major migrations to common moulting sites) (Johnsgard 1978). The autumn migration begins in September (Scott and Rose 1996) and the species returns from the wintering grounds as early as February (Scott and Rose 1996). It is gregarious during the winter and on migration (Kear 2005), flocks of up to a hundred or more occurring in suitable sites during the autumn (although it travels in much smaller flocks during the spring) (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds along the wooded shorelines (Kear 2005) of deep lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), small rivers and streams (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) with moderate currents (Snow and Perrins 1998) in the tundra, boreal and temperate forest zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), as well as on more saline waters such as sheltered shallow bays, inlets, straits or estuaries with sandy rather than muddy substrates (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for narrow channels rather than open expanses of water, with islands or islets and spits, projecting rocks or grassy banks (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> The majority of the species winters at sea (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), frequenting both inshore and offshore waters, estuaries, bays and brackish lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), but showing a preference for clear, shallow waters not affected by heavy wave action (Johnsgard 1978). It will also utilise large freshwater lakes on passage (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of small, shoaling marine or freshwater fish (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), as well as small amounts of plant material (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992) and aquatic invertebrates (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992), such as crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and crayfish) (Johnsgard 1978), worms and insects (Kear 2005). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed within 25 m of water (Kear 2005) in a variety of locations such as natural cavities on the ground (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005), burrows (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005), under boulders (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst tree or scrub roots (Snow and Perrins 1998), in tree cavities, artificial nestboxes (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst reeds, or on floating reed mats (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Northern breeding populations of this species are fully migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998) although breeders in temperate regions are sedentary or only travel short distances (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). The species arrives on its breeding areas between March and May (Scott and Rose 1996), actually breeding as early as late-March (although often considerably later in more northerly regions) (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to 8-10 individuals (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) (especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations) (Johnsgard 1978). The males gather to moult after mating, often undertaking considerable moult migrations to flock on key waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females also undergo a post-breeding moult on the breeding grounds during which they become flightless for around 1 month (Johnsgard 1978). The main migration to wintering areas largely occurs from October through to December (Scott and Rose 1996), mass departures being linked to the freezing of breeding and moulting areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species is typically found in small parties, with groups of up to 70 individuals feeding together on shoals of fish during the winter (Kear 2005). Large flocks may also form on roosting waters (Madge and Burn 1988), the largest gatherings occurring during the autumn migration and winter months and numbering up to several thousands of individuals (Madge and Burn 1988) (1,000 to 10,000 on suitable waters) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On passage in the spring flocks are usually small however, with breeding pairs remaining in flocks until they reach the breeding grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on large clear freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005), pools (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), the upper reaches of rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) and streams (Kear 2005) in the boreal, montane (Kear 2005) and temperate forest zones (Johnsgard 1978). It requires waters with a fairly high productivity of fish (Kear 2005) surrounded by mature hard-wood trees with holes excavated by woodpeckers or natural cavities for nesting in (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on large unfrozen lakes, rivers, lagoons, brackish waters and marshes (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), generally avoiding highly saline waters (Madge and Burn 1988) although it may move to estuaries, coastal lagoons and sheltered sea coasts with waters less than 10 m deep in particularly harsh winters (Scott and Rose 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) less than 10 cm long (Kear 2005), but may also include aquatic invertebrates (such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, and adult and larval insects), amphibians, small mammals and birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The species nests in holes excavated by large woodpeckers or natural cavities in mature hardwood trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) with entry holes more than 15 m above the ground (Kear 2005). It shows a preference for cavities with openings c.12 cm wide and internal diameters of c.25 cm (Johnsgard 1978) in trees close to or up to 1 km away from water (Snow and Perrins 1998). When natural tree-nesting sites are not available (Johnsgard 1978) the species will use artificial nestboxes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) or may nest among tree roots in undercut banks, on cliff ledges (Kear 2005), in rock clefts (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) or in dense scrub or loose boulders on islands (Kear 2005). Sometimes several females may nest in the same tree (Madge and Burn 1988), especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Management information </strong>Artificial nestboxes commonly used are 85-100 cm high with openings 50-60 cm from the base (Johnsgard 1978).","<p>The species is subject to persecution by anglers and fish-farmers who perceive it as a competitor and accuse it of depleting their fish stocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Eradication efforts may lead to long-term depression of Goosander populations (with little improvement in fish survival rates) (Pearce <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species suffers occasional entrapment in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm, with records of bycatch from China (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is also at risk from degradation of freshwater lakes resulting from drainage and petroleum pollution in Russia (Grishanov 2006) and acid rain in North America (Kear 2005). The species is susceptible to avian influenza and is at risk from future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Hunting occurs in North America (Kear 2005) and Russia (Grishanov 2006), but the Goosander is not a popular game bird (Kear 2005). Its eggs used to be, and possibly still are, harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979). Present harvesting levels are sufficiently low not to be driving declines.</p>","The global population is estimated to number c.1,700,000-2,400,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

It breeds between May and July (although the exact timing varies with temperature and food availability) in solitary pairs or colonies of a few to several hundred pairs (usually 2-25) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and remains gregarious throughout the year especially when roosting, foraging and on passage (Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species generally feeds within 3 km of breeding colonies, but may occasionally forage up to 50 km away (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). On its wintering grounds in Antarctica, it may also forage in association with Antarctic Minke Whale <em>Balaenoptera bonaerensis</em> in the open ocean north of the pack-ice zone (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds along northern coastlines and on inshore islands, as well as inland on tundra and forest-tundra (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for habitats with a vegetation cover of less than 40 %, nesting on sand or shingle beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground and small islands in lakes and coastal lagoons (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also nest on islets or banks along rivers, on swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks and reed-covered flats, or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows and sedge grassland not far from water (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species also forages offshore, in ice-filled coastal bays or over wet tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> On passage, it largely flies over open ocean, resting at sea on kelp, logs or flotsam, but may occur inland or along coastlines on beaches, reefs and spits (Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter, the species is pelagic, foraging at the edges of pack-ice, icebergs and ice-floes near shore (especially in channels between ice-floes) and up to 24 km offshore, often in association with Antarctic Minke Whale <em>Balaenoptera bonaerensis</em> (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It also roosts on ice-floes and icebergs during this season (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish<strong></strong> as well as crustaceans (especially planktonic species), molluscs, insects (e.g. caterpillars, Chironomidae) and earthworms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It will also take berries in the early spring on arrival on its breeding grounds, but does not readily switch to other prey items when preferred prey supplies fail (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape in sand, shingle or turf on beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground, small islands in lakes, coastal lagoons and rivers, swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks and reed-covered flats, or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows and sedge grassland not far from water (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It will also nest on artificial structures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","<p>Arctic Tern colonies are threatened by invasive American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>, which have been shown to reduce tern reproductive success through nest predation and increase the risks taken by adults in defending the nest (NordstrÃ¶m <em>et al.</em> 2004). It has been shown, however, that control measures are helping to reduce predation (Mavor <em>et al. </em>2005) and the long-term removal of mink reduces risk taking by adults during nest defence (NordstrÃ¶m <em>et al.</em> 2004). Arctic Terns also suffer a loss of reproductive success due to egging, which is ongoing in some areas. In some areas, such as Belcher Island and Resurrection Bay, Alaska, egging may have caused the abandonment of colonies (Gilchrist and Robertson 1999, Griswold 2016), with the latter occurring after the reported harvesting of every Arctic Tern egg present in the colony (Griswold 2016).</p>  <p>Arctic Terns are projected to lose 20-50% of their habitat due to the temperature changes linked to a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> (BirdLife International unpublished). Sandeel is a key prey item, and major breeding failures are caused by food shortage (Schreiber and Kissling 2005). Increasing sea temperatures in the North Sea have been linked to reduced sandeel recruitment, likely causing a population decline (Vigfusdottir <em>et al.</em> 2013). Low sandeel populations have been linked with breeding failure through abandonment of clutches and chick starvation (Vigfusdottir 2012). Climate change already seeing shifts in copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em>, underpinning much of food web (Frederiksen <em>et al.</em> 2013), which will likely have knock-on effects on sandeels. Further, in some areas, sandeel populations are decreasing due to overfishing. Dispersal ability and carrying capacity of northern areas will dictate population dynamics of Arctic Tern. Models predict that in the UK, only the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Islands and the northerly tip of Scotland will maintain Arctic Tern breeding colonies (Daunt and Mitchell 2013).</p>","The global   population is estimated to number &gt;2,000,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 564,000-906,000 pairs, which equates to 1,130,000-1,810,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The population in Russia has been estimated at   c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration   (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar range, breeding in the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America as far south as Brittany (<strong>France</strong>) and Massachusetts (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>).

Habitats include small pools, marshes with patches of open water and secluded sections of larger lakes and rivers (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;The nest is a platform of aquatic vegetation either floating and anchored to emergent vegetation, built from the lake bottom (where water is shallow) or built on rocks at water level (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;In its wintering range, the species frequents coastal inshore waters up to 10-20 m in depth including sheltered bays, lagoons and estuaries (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, FjeldsÃ¥ 2004). It may also occur on large lake and river systems south of its breeding range (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, FjeldsÃ¥ 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Its diet consists predominantly of fish and invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, mayflies, water bugs, damselflies and caddisflies), crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimp, cladocerans, amphipods, decapods, crayfish and crabs), molluscs and worms (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Konter 2001, FjeldsÃ¥ 2004). Fish and crustaceans are more important components of the diet during the winter when the species is at sea (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;This species is fully migratory and travels over land in stages on a broad front, some populations only moving short distances to the nearest ice-free coast (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, FjeldsÃ¥ 2004).","<p>The majority of the breeding range of the species lies within areas used for forestry, which is believed to have significantly impacted the area of suitable breeding habitat available to Horned Grebes (Llimona <em>et al. </em>2014). Afforestation can lead to hydrological changes that reduce the availability of invertebrate prey to the grebe, and climate change appears to be having similar impacts through the drying of wetlands leading to overgrowth by plants, especially in the southern part of the range (A. Mischenko&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017). Dams also impact habitat suitability, however, they are likely to only impact a small minority of the population and may also provide additional habitat in parts of the range. There has also been a loss of habitat to agricultural development and rural development across the range, for example more than ten percent of the overall five percent decrease in wetland area in the Prairies of Canada was due to land being built upon (COSEWIC 2009). Development is likely to also bring disturbance to the birds, which may cause nest abandonment (Stedman 2018). Despite this, the species' range remains very large and, as such, these threats are likely to only affect a small fraction of the population. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through agricultural run-off, which is thought to degrade the nutritional quality of the prey base and nutrient status of the water has been related to breeding success in Scotland (Summers <em>et al</em>. 2011). The introduction of large fish, such as the Rainbow Trout&#160;<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>, to many inland water bodies is likely to result in resource competition for invertebrate and small fish prey (HELCOM 2013). It is not clear that trout are actually affecting a majority of the global population, as no impact detected in a study in Scotland (Summers <em>et al.</em> 2011) which indicated that pike was a more significant source of mortality.</p><p>Horned Grebes are commonly caught and accidentally drowned in fishing nets (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992), with bycatch in nearshore gill-nets&#160; a potential significant source of mortality in much of the range as they appear highly susceptible to capture (more so than seaduck when accoutning for abundance) (Zydelis <em>et al. </em>2013). The species is also particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the marine environment during the winter (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, FjeldsÃ¥ 2004, COSEWIC 2009).

When it first arrives on the breeding grounds, however, the species is dependent upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails&#160;<em>Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab&#160;<em>Limulus</em>&#160;spp. eggs) (Karpanty&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It is a full long-distance migrant that utilises few stopover sites or staging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The species is vulnerable to extensive land reclamation projects that encroach upon important habitat across its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Kraan <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016, Piersma <em>et al. </em>2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region with the populations of&#160;<em>C. c. piersmai</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. rogersi</em>&#160;both being threatened by development at key staging sites in Bohai Bay, China (Rogers <em>et al. </em>2010, Yang <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Damming of rivers, dredging (which reduces food availability), pollution, aquaculture operations, renewable energy developments, oil exploration and invasion of mudflats by <em>Spartina</em> grasses pose additional threats to key habitats (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), residential development (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014) foot-traffic on beaches (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Lilleyman <em>et al. </em>2016), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the past, increased harvesting of Horseshoe Crab <em>Limulus polyphemus</em> in Delaware Bay, U.S.A. resulted in reduced prey availability (McGowan <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is hunted illegally for example in New Zealand (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) and northern Brazil (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014), and potentially in China (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<em>C. c. islandica</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. canutus</em>&#160;are both huntable in France and hunting of other species can cause disturbance and accidental mortality. The species can also suffer mortality by incidentally being caught in fish traps (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). It has been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), although testing since 1992 in northwest Australia has not found any evidence for this disease in the species there (Curran <em>et al. </em>2014). Climate change induced sea level rise and thawing of permafrost pose threats to intertidal staging areas, non-breeding sites and Arctic breeding areas (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wauchope <em>et al. </em>2016).","The global   population is estimated to number 891,000-979,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 15,000-30,000 pairs, which equates to 30,000-60,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015), and the population overwintering in Australia and the Americas have been estimated at 110,000 individuals (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2016) and 44,763 individuals (Niles <em>et al. </em>2010) respectively.",Decreasing,"The species has an extremely large range, breeding from Alaska (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) across the Arctic to Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>Russia</strong>.

It has therefore been uplisted to Vulnerable. The cause(s) of declines are unknown, but are likely multi-faceted and further research is needed to inform conservation actions.</p>","This species is marine and pelagic, often occurring in areas of convergence or upwelling or over continental shelves, rarely coming near land except at colonies. During the breeding season, birds from the western Atlantic are highly pelagic in their foraging habits, travelling to deep (median &gt;1,950 m) and relatively unproductive waters (chlorophyll a concentrations &lt;0.5 mg/m3) over and beyond continental slopes lying, on average, 400 to 830 km from colonies (Pollet <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hedd <em>et al</em>. 2018). Its diet comprises mainly of small fish, squid, planktonic crustaceans and offal which it catches on the wing by dipping, skimming or snatching from the surface. It sometimes follows marine mammals feeding on leftovers or faeces. Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","<p>Brown Rats&#160;<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>&#160;and House Rats&#160;<em>R. rattus</em>, are considered to exert a considerable predation pressure on the species where they establish on breeding islands, and may be a key determinant of the present breeding distribution, possibly along with cats. Cats&#160;<em>Felis catus</em>&#160;predate large numbers of adult and fledgling Leach's Storm-petrels where present, and may have been responsible for the extirpation of the species from a number of formerly occupied sites. Foxes caused the extirpation of the species from numerous islands in Alaska following their introduction, with their eradication on a number of islands leading to subsequent recolonization by Leachâs Storm-petrel. Mice&#160;<em>Mus musculus&#160;</em>are also suspected to be impacting the species through nest predation, but the effects are unclear.<br/><br/>Leachâs Storm-petrel&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous&#160;</em>experiences high levels of predation from native predators. In 1997, Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus&#160;</em>killed almost 49,000 adult petrels during the breeding season on Great Island, Newfoundland, which at the time had a breeding colony of around 270,000 pairs (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000). Great Skuas <em>Catharacta skua</em>&#160;predate Leachâs Storm-petrels, with around 21,000 individuals killed each year in the St. Kilda colony; however, these primarily represent non-breeding birds that had immigrated from other, larger colonies, hence this is thought to have a relatively small impact on the population (Stead 2010). Great <em>Larus marinus&#160;</em>and Lesser Black-backed Gulls <em>L. fuscus&#160;</em>are also known to predate relatively large numbers of adult Leach's Storm-petrel (Stenhouse <em>et al.</em> 2000), though the extent to which this drives declines is uncertain.</p>  <p>Research activities have been shown to cause considerable disturbance to Leachâs Storm-petrel and represent a cause of reduced reproductive success. In a study by Blackmer (2004), it was found that weekly investigator disturbance halved the hatching success of Leachâs Storm-petrel nests, and daily disturbance caused a 56% reduction. Of all the reproductive failures in this study, egg desertion accounted for 91% and only occurred in pairs in the disturbed treatment groups.</p>  Foraging ranges during the breeding season for five out of seven western Atlantic colonies overlapped with offshore oil and gas operations; three of these colonies have declined in recent decades (Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2018). Attraction to lights and flares and subsequent collisions with oil rigs poses a risk (Hedd <em>et al. </em>2018). Large oil spills represent a relatively unlikely but potentially very severe threat, although due to this birdâs large range, it would be likely to affect only a small portion of the population. Small spills of hydrocarbons and synthetic drilling fluids are relatively common (CNLOPB 2012, McCrary <em>et al.</em> 2003) and contribute to chronic oil pollution in the sea (National Research Council 1985).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;20,000,000 individuals. &#160;Based on the compilation of available data the current population comprises 6.7-8.3 million breeding pairs; 40-48% of these breed in the Atlantic basin and 52-60% in the Pacific. Throughout the western Atlantic (&gt;90% of basin total), populations are declining, including at Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, Canada, home to the largest colony. The population at Baccalieu Island, estimated at 3.3 million breeding pairs in 1984 (Sklepkovych and Montevecchi 1989), had declined to 2.02 million pairs by 2013 (Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>), and the former second and third regionally largest colonies have declined by &gt;50% since the late 1990s (Wilhelm <em>et al. </em>2015, Environment Canada <em>unpublished data</em>). In the eastern Atlantic, the population at St. Kilda is also declining, this being the largest colony in the UK and Ireland (Newson <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Population trends in the Pacific are less well known. In Alaska, where Leachâs&#160;<em>Hydrobates leucorhous</em>&#160;and Fork-tailed Storm-petrels <em>H. furactus</em> are largely combined for monitoring purposes, population trends are stable or increasing (Slater and Byrd 2009, Dragoo <em>et al</em>. 2016), the large population at Daikoku Island, Japan may have declined since 1982, while trends of western North American and Russian populations are unknown. Despite these knowledge gaps, compiling available data collected between 1977 and 2016, representing 75-80% of the global population (including Europe, eastern North America, and Japan), points to a decline of â¥30% over three generations (39 years, based on a generation length estimated by BirdLife to be 13 years).<br/><br/>Definitive information on Leachâs Storm-petrel population decline comes mainly from colonies within the Atlantic basin. &#160;Recent genetics research indicates that while there is no genetic structure among Atlantic colonies, populations within the Atlantic and the Pacific are genetically distinct (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;Evidence of movement of pre-breeding birds among colonies within the Atlantic, led to the conclusion that North Atlantic birds may be operating as a metapopulation and that management of this species may be best viewed at an oceanic scale (Bicknell <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has an extensive global range.

Males undergo short post-breeding moult migrations<strong></strong>, often gathering in small or large flocks (up to 4,000 in Iceland) (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> while females are incubating (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females usually moult in the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, although large concentrations (500-1,000 individuals) of moulting females have been recorded away from breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. During the moulting period the species is flightless for a period of c.3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong> leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season<strong></strong> and is commonly observed in small or large flocks<strong></strong> sometimes of several thousand individuals (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The return spring migration generally begins in late-February (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> although flocks of non-breeders may remain in the south, often in winter quarters, during the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in tundra, wooded tundra<strong></strong> and moorland regions in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, occupying small, shallow<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes, pools and rivers<strong></strong> with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on shallow coastal waters&#160; less than 10 m deep<strong></strong> (especially in the vicinity of sewage outlets)<strong></strong>, as well as sheltered bays<strong></strong>, estuaries <strong></strong> and brackish coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is also found inland on large lakes <strong></strong> and reservoirs during this season (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. During the winter, its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs (Johnsgard 1978) such as muscles, cockles and clams while in coastal habitats and <em>Hydrobia </em>snails while in brackish waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). Other food sources include insects<strong></strong>, aquatic insect larvae<strong></strong>, crustaceans such as amphipods, worms, small fish<em></em><strong></strong>, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges <em></em>and water weeds (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding</strong> The nest is a shallow depression close to water<strong></strong> on the ground<strong></strong>, either in thick vegetation<strong></strong>, in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). The species is not colonial but it will sometimes nest among gulls and terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, with neighbouring nests being placed as close as 1 m in some areas (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth, a large marine bay, resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>. It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries poses a major threat to this species which shows a relatively high vulnerability to bycatch (Sonntag <em>et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range.  </p><p>Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Audubonâs (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaupâs habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017).</p>  <p>Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (DÃ¼rr 2013 <em>per</em> Fox <em>et al. </em>2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt &amp; Langston 2006).<br/></p>  At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was  associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.<p></p>  <p></p>","The global population is estimated to number c. 4,920,000-5,130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).&#160;The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 134,000-178,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-355,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"Summer breeding grounds of the species range across the northern limits of Europe (including <strong>Iceland</strong>) and Asia, through the Aleutian Islands (year-round breeding) to Alaska (<strong>USA</strong>), and across to the Atlantic coast of <strong>Canada </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

Number of wintering birds were 25% lower in oiled areas following the Exxon Valdez spill, and still showed reduced survival rates 11-14 years after the incident, suggesting chronic oil contamination. Full recovery after the catastrophic Exxon Valdez spill was estimated to take 24 years (Iveson and Esler 2010). The species is threatened by the development of hydroelectric schemes which result in the diversion and siltation of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). Damming is affecting populations in Europe, Newfoundland and to a lesser extent, the West coast of North America. One colony has already been lost due to diversion of the river Thorisos, following the installation of a hydroelectric dam. Hunting occurs at low levels throughout the speciesâ range, with small bag limits in most areas (e.g. 134 annually in western Washington between 2004-2014), and although more than 1,000 are taken annually in Alaska (Sea Duck Joint Venture 2015), the annual level of subsistence harvest is estimated at an additional 2,080 birds (Rothe <em>et al.</em> 2015). The large-scale introduction of Atlantic Salmon (<em>Salmo samar</em>) and Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>) can result in competition for blackfly larvae and pupae, the duck's main food source. In the 1930s American Mink (<em>Mustela vison</em>) were introduced to the European range and may have reduced breeding success although the impact has not been quantified (Tucker and Heath 1994).

Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of the Surf Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009; Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, but are now at risk of loss or degradation; remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005, Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006).

The species breeds from April in solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), after which it undertakes short northerly moult migrations to coastal areas, large lakes and rivers (Kear 2005) to undergo a period of flightless moult lasting 3-4 weeks (males leave for this moult migration first while females are still incubating) (Scott and Rose 1996). Large moult gatherings are common during this period, males arriving at such gatherings in early-June and numbers peaking in late-August when adult females arrive (Scott and Rose 1996). The southward autumn migration begins in late-August with most arriving in the winter quarters by early-December (Scott and Rose 1996). Females tend to migrate further than males and juveniles migrate further than adults (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration to the breeding areas occurs as early as mid-February, the species timing its arrival to coincide with the thawing and appearance of open water (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). Non-breeders may also over-summer on wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season usually being observed in small scattered groups or in small flocks on migration (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Several hundred individuals may roost together (Snow and Perrins 1998) and large flocks often gather to feed at sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) during the winter, although the species rarely occurs in very large flocks (Scott and Rose 1996). <br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species is restricted to water close to the shore and less than 10 m deep, showing a preference for waters 4 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Breeding</em> When breeding the species shows a preference for oligotrophic lakes devoid of fish but with abundant invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), and requires tree-holes (or artificial nestboxes) for nesting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Suitable habitats include freshwater lakes, pools, rivers and deep marshes surrounded by coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters mainly at sea on inshore waters, shallow bays, estuaries and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005), especially in the vicinity of sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Further to the south and on migration the species may also frequent large rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The diet of the species consists predominantly of aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, worms, crustaceans, aquatic insects and insect larvae (e.g. dragonflies, damsel flies and may flies) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as amphibians, small fish and some plant material (mainly in the autumn) such as seeds, roots and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The species nests in hollows of mature trees (e.g. aspen, spruce or oak) formed by woodpeckers or by bacterial or fungal heart-rot invasions that have internal cavity diameters of c.20 cm, although the height of the hollow does not seem to be important (Johnsgard 1978, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005). The species will preferentially nest in trees in open stands near water or solitary trees on the edges of marshes, rather than in trees in dense stands in order to increase the ease of entry by flying (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988). The species will also nest in artificial nest-boxes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong><br/>Management information </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth (a large marine bay) resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984). It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984). In some areas nestbox erection programmes have been shown to cause significant range expansions and population increases (Dennis 1987, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although an experiment in southern Finland found that even though nestbox provision increased breeding numbers of the species there was a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive output (i.e. the number of fledged young did not increase despite an increase in breeding pairs) (Poysa and Poysa 2002). Nesting habitats in general may also benefit from a more extended rotation of timber harvesting (Kear 2005).","<p>The species is threatened by wetland degradation and loss in North America and is susceptible to atmospheric acid deposition (e.g. acid rain) throughout a large part of its breeding range (Kear 2005). The main threat to the species in its wintering range is pollution, e.g. from coastal oil spills or other pollutants from sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Modern forestry management work is also limiting the suitable area of breeding habitat by removing old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The timber industry is thought to be compromising the population in large parts of the range. The placing of nest-boxes to compensate for the loss of natural nesting sites has not been very effective, as the species reaches an apparent density-dependent plateau in breeding success (Finland), which may indicate that nesting resource is not the primary limiting factor constraining the population. However, in other parts of the species' range (North America) use of nest-boxes has been found to increase the breeding range and productivity of Common Goldeneye. Historically, an estimated 100,000â250,000 were shot annually in north-west and central Europe. The species is still hunted at sustainable levels in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006), while hunting elsewhere has unquantified effects on the global populations (Kear 2005), though not thought to drive any significant declines. Lead shot ingestion does not appear to be a significant risk, at least when compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2014). The introduction of invertebrate-eating fish such as Perch, <em>Perca spp.</em>, to many lakes where they were not formerly present leads to increased resource competition which has been experimentally shown to negatively affect the Common Goldeneye (Nummi <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/></p>","The global   population is estimated to number c.2,700,000-4,700,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).

It can be seen nesting as high as 3,000 m in the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.).&#160;The species uses relatively productive lakes and rivers in Iceland. It is a hole-nesting species using natural holes in lava fields and nest boxes erected on farmhouses at the edge of the breeding area (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying is usually from mid-May although slightly earlier if using nest boxes. It lays 8 to 11 eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2018). It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates (Tucker and Heath 1994). Summer foods include insects and their larvae and plant material, whereas winter diet consists mainly of molluscs and crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). The species is not truly migratory, with some populations mostly sedentary, e.g. Iceland, and others moving distances of &gt;1,000 km (Carboneras and Kirwan 2018). In Iceland there appears to be a large sex imbalance (<em>per</em> Carboneras and Kirwan 2018), but the causes of this are uncertain","Hunting occurs on both coasts of North America and eggs are collected in Iceland, but harvest is subject to quotas set to minimise any population impact (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2000, Carboneras and Kirwan 2018), hence the present level of hunting is thought to be sustainable for the Icelandic and US west coast populations, but could potentially have a larger impact on the much smaller population on the US east coast (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2000). Agro-industry plantations have contributed to habitat restrictions due to the loss or degradation of old forest featuring dead trees and large trees with dead limbs, which make for suitable nest cavities. The decrease in available nesting sites may have caused increased chick mortality due to greater distances separating nest holes from water (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000, Environment Canada 2013). Oil spills may pose a serious risk both through direct mortality from oiling and longer-term effects of chronic contamination pollution. In particular, the species may be exposed to pollutants when aggregating in wintering grounds which overlap with industrialised seaways such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Vancouver, Kittimat and Alice Arm and Baie-Comeau (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000). The species is also at risk from contamination of food resources, in particular blue mussels, which is a preferred prey item (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Europe, the species is mainly confined to a small area in northeastern Iceland, with 85-90% of the national population occurring at Lake MÃ½vatn and the River LaxÃ¡. Such a locally concentrated distribution makes the European population vulnerable to stochastic events, and the 1989 crash in food resources led to a halving of the Icelandic populations (Kear 2005). The planned introduction of Atlantic salmon <em>Salmo salar</em> into the river systems and sediment dredging in Lake MÃ½vatn (Einarsson and MagnÃºsdÃ³ttir 1993) could have negative effects on future food availability through altered trophic dynamics in the ecosystem (Kear 2005).","The European population is estimated at 800-900 pairs, which equates to 1,600-1,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

One parent remains at the colony with the chick whilst the other is on a foraging trip. Birds departing colonies usually splash-down to form large rafts close to the colony before departing to foraging areas. External radio tagging has been shown to adversely effect breeding, whereas birds fitted with internal transmitters behaved as normal (Wanless <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 1988, Nevins 2004). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>During the breeding season, schooling pelagic fish species are the most important prey for adults, though benthic species can also be important. In Labrador, Canada, shannies (Sticheaidae) were the main source of food, comprising 84%  of the diet in 1996 and 52.9% in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). Capelin (<em>Mallotus villosus</em>) were also important, forming 44.7% of the diet in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). In the UK, the main prey taxa are sandeel (<em>Ammodytes </em>spp.) and clupeids. Small gadoids are also important at some colonies. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Foraging range </strong>This species dives to maximum depths of 170-230 m. During the breeding season, surveys recorded the highest densities of birds in the 51 - 100 m depth zone, although birds were still abundant in water less than 50 m and 101 - 200 m deep. Very few were seen in deeper areas (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990). The foraging range of this species appears variable across seasons and years. At the Isle of May, Scotland, during 1986 around 70% of foraging trips were over 7 km from the colony, whereas in the following year the birds tended to make shorter trips (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990). Foraging trips in eastern Canada are within 100 km (Cairns <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 1987, Davoren <em>et al.</em> 2003), and in Pribilof Islands, Alaska, foraging occurred mostly within 60 km. In Witless Bay, Newfoundland, foraging aggregations formed over large Capelin schools within 5 km of breeding sites. Along the Newfoundland coastline, aggregations occurred within 15 km of the colonies, and at an offshore ridge about 80 km southeast of the colonies. Despite these large foraging radii, waters close to the colony were the most frequent destination of feeding birds. This was particularly true during chick rearing, when only one third of feeding trips could have exceeded 10 km from the colony (Cairns <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 1987).<strong> </strong>In Pribilof Islands, Alaska, birds showed a consistent preference for shallower waters (Schneider and Hunt 1984).<strong> </strong>High densities of foraging birds have also been observed foraging over a submarine ridge (Coyle <em>et al.</em> 1992).<strong> </strong>In Kachemak Bay, Alaska, it appears that birds tend to feed over rocky substrates in water depths of about 18 to 55 m (Sanger 1987). They have also been observed to forage in riptides (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1990), and in areas of sandy sediment suitable for sandeels (Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1998, BirdLife International 2000).<strong> </strong>Near Flamborough Head, UK, the Farallones, California, and Pribilof Islands, Alaska, birds forage at fronts between thermally distinct bodies of water. In the UK, this occurs at a seasonally-occuring front between thermally-mixed and thermally-stratified water, whereas in the Farallones, the front was between cold and salty upwellings and estuarine outflow (Decker and Hunt 1996, BirdLife International 2000).","This species is in direct competition with fisheries for food and, as such, overfishing of certain stocks appears to have direct impacts on Common Murres. The collapse of the Barents Sea capelin stock led to an 85% reduction in the breeding population on Bear Island with no signs of recovery (Nettleship <em>et al.</em> 2018). Mortality due to unregulated gill-net fisheries may also be significant (Nettleship <em>et al.</em> 2018). Oil pollution from vessels sunk during World War II is thought to be responsible for the sharp decline in Irish Sea colonies during the mid-20th century, from which the affected populations are yet to recover fully (Birkhead 2016). Hunting in the Faeroes, Greenland and Newfoundland is unregulated and may be occurring at unsustainable levels. No formal assessment has been made of sustainable harvest levels for this species (Nettleship <em>et al. </em>2018). The Common Murre is also sensitive to variations in sea surface temperature, with a 1ËC change in temperature linked to an annual population decline of c.10% (Irons <em>et al.</em> 2008).","The global   population is estimated to number &gt;18,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1996).&#160;The European population is estimated at 2,350,000-3,060,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"This species has a circumpolar distribution, occurring in the low-arctic and boreal waters of the North Atlantic and North Pacific (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/><em>Uria aalge ibericus</em> is found on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.

It forages mainly in offshore waters to the edge of the continental shelf, but may also be found inshore, where oceanographic processes concentrated food near the sea surface. It winters well offshore, often off the shelf break, but also over inshore waters, where food concentration is high. Its distribution is determined largely by concentrations of planktonic crustaceans and small fish. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet is comprised mainly of planktonic crustaceans and small larval fish, with the specific prey species varying both geographically and temporally. Feeding usually occurs in small flocks by diving. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding </strong>Individuals arrive in the vicinity of colonies a month before laying, from early spring to mid-summer depending on the locality. It is colonial, but occurs at low densities, and is often associated with other alcids. It is nocturnal at colonies, nesting in burrows excavated in soil, but also in rock crevices and cavities and occasionally in holes dug by other subterranean nesters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Climate change probably poses the greatest threat to the species. The 1997â1998 El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event had a strong effect on breeding success, reducing the number of chicks per pair from more than 1.4 to below 1, mostly caused by desertions before incubation began. Gaston and Smith (2001) found a positive correlation between May sea surface temperature (SST) and the slope of the regression of chick mass at colony departure on a particular date for a given year. Climate change is thought to be driving declines or fluctuations, yet further changes in SST and more frequent ENSO patterns in the future could accentuate the risk to the species. <br/>Invasive species are present in parts of the range, exerting negative impacts on local populations through predation. Breeding populations have been declining on both islands where rats <em>Rattus </em>spp. are present; the Lyell Island population declined by 22% over a 10-year period, and the one on Kunghit Island declined by more than 50% over seven years and appeared to be completely extirpated by 2004. Estimates of breeding populations in three rat-free colonies suggest stable or increasing numbers over 18- and 11-year periods (Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007). The suggestion that racoons <em>Procyon lotor </em>have been responsible for many seabird losses over the last decades is supported by changes in predation levels recorded between years and corresponding seabird population trends. Predation levels were similar in 1990 and 1991, in the presence of raccoons, but declined by 80% in 1992, following the removal of three raccoons. Raccoon predation represents a conservation threat of international significance, because the Queen Charlotte Islands contain the majority of the world's Ancient Murrelet population, as well as substantial populations of several other burrow-nesting species that are also susceptible to raccoon predation (Hartman <em>et al.</em> 1997).","The global population is estimated to number c.1,000,000-2,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).

It feeds mostly on crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by other invertebrates and small larval fish. The start of the breeding season varies greatly with latitude, from November in Baja California to July in Alaska. Birds form colonies from under 500 birds to over one million, usually at high densities on coastal islands with or without trees, and nesting on a wide range of habitats. It winters mainly offshore within the breeding range, with southerly populations being relatively sedentary compared to northern individuals which migrate south (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Introduced predators represent the most serious threat to Cassinâs Auklet colonies (Nettleship 1996, Rodway and Lemon 2011). House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> were introduced on Langara in the early 20th century (first noted in 1946), followed by Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> a few decades later (first noted in 1981) (Bertram and Nagorsen 1995). The auklet population on Langara and adjacent Cox and Lucy islands was extirpated by 1981 (Drent and Guiguet 1961, Rodway 1991) and only small numbers of auklets had recolonized Langara by 2004 (Regehr <em>et al.</em> 2007). Similarly, as House Rats invaded Anacapa, the local auklet population was completely or nearly extirpated between 1910 and 1975. After rat eradication, a total of 42 auklet nests in six discrete breeding areas were discovered between 2003 and 2012 (Whitworth <em>et al.</em> 2015). Recurring recolonization following rat eradication from the species's previous range indicate the substantial impact of rat predation on the species's distribution. Cats <em>Felis catus</em> were the likely driver of elimination or severe reductions, as it occurred in colonies from four Mexican islands (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Wolf<em> et al</em>. 2006). Raccoons <em>Procyon lotor </em>were introduced to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the early 1940s (which hold 18% of the world population of Cassin's Auklet), and two to four raccoons alone were responsible for up to 80% of observed predation on sub-adult and adult birds, while also depredating eggs and chicks (Hartman <em>et al. </em>1997). Further range expansion by raccoons in this region may pose a significant conservation threat to the seabird populations on the islands (Hartman and Eastman 1999).</p>  <p>Red foxes <em>Vulpes vulpes </em>occur naturally on some near-shore islands along the Alaska Peninsula and on the Fox Islands in the eastern Aleutians. Following the release of foxes on more than 450 previously fox-free Alaskan islands, populations of nesting birds were severely reduced through increased predation levels on eggs, nestlings and adult birds (Bailey and Kaiser 1993). Currently, fox predation pressure may be alleviating, due to their removal from 39 islands of more than 500,000 ha. Further eradications are being planned for at least four more islands (Veitch and Clout 2002).&#160;Light pollution may cause disorientation of auklets and prolong the period of effective predation. Exceptionally bright lights used in the squid jigging fishery close to breeding colonies lead to greatly increased predation by Barn Owls&#160;<em>Tyto alba&#160;</em>and possibly Western Gulls&#160;<em>Larus occidentalis</em>, and may also cause collision mortality and discourage adults from returning to shore (Harfenist 2004).</p>  <p>In addition to predation pressures, the species's habitat is threatened by introduced herbivores which destroy and degrade nesting habitat by trampling nests, browsing native vegetation and increasing erosion of topsoil. Goats <em>Capra hircus</em> introduced to Guadalupe Island in the 1800s intensively trampled and browsed the nesting habitat of the Guadalupe Storm-petrel <em>Oceanodroma macrodactyla</em>, likely contributing to the apparent extinction of the species (Wolf<em> et al.</em> 2006). Considering the Cassinâs Auklets similar burrowing nesting habit, it is also at risk from habitat destruction by goats. Likewise, rabbits have been considered a threat due to habitat conversion and competition with burrowing birds. However, Hipfner<em> et al. </em>(2010) found similar vegetation changes on Triangle Island which hosts rabbits and the neighbouring rabbit-free Sartine Island. Although the driving mechanism is uncertain, the decrease in Tufted Hairgrass <em>Deschampsia cespitosa </em>cover at the expense of Salmonberry <em>Rubus spectabilis </em>poses a serious risk to the species, restricting the area of suitable nesting habitat.</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly changes in sea temperature regimes and coastal upwelling systems (Wolf <em>et al. </em>2010). The frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions is expected to increase, threatening the long-term stability of the Cassinâs Auklet population through decreased availability of krill and associated mortality and low recruitment. Low breeding success has been documented in strong El NiÃ±o years (e.g., 1983, 1992, and 1997) (Manugian <em>et al. </em>2015). During a 15-year study period (1994â2008), two extreme climate events (a strong El NiÃ±o event in 1997â1998 and an atmospheric blocking event in 2005) were both associated with a halving of the adult survival of female Cassin's Auklets (Morrison<em> et al. </em>2011). Auklets have shown ability to respond adaptively to variation in oceanographic conditions and prey availability by modifying timing of breeding; however, in years when ocean conditions deteriorated after the initiation of breeding, prey availability was severely reduced beyond the birdsâ potential for an adaptive response, resulting in diminished nestling growth and productivity (Abraham and Sydeman 2004). Negative effects of climatic variation on both reproductive success and the survival of adult females is thought to be driving the ongoing decline in the Cassin's Auklet population on Triangle Island (Morrison<em> et al.</em> 2011). Likewise, the fluctuations in the northern Californian populations may be partially explained by anomalous warm-water conditions (Nettleship 1996), which are also thought to be responsible for mass die-offs reported from California to central British Columbia in 2014 (Welch 2015).</p>  <p>Oil pollution represents a significant threat and extractive operations may impact negatively on the species through increased pollution and collision with lights (Harfenist 2004). Past oil spills are known to have impacted the species. For example, in the 1986 Apex Houston oil spill, an estimated total of 10,577 birds were debilitated or killed (Page and Carter 1986, Page <em>et al. </em>1990), including 'a smaller number' of Cassin's Auklets (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2003). Sub-lethal doses of petroleum have been found to reduce reproductive success in the species (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1981).</p>  <p>Declines have also been attributed to increases in numbers of native predators, including Bald Eagle <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>, Peregrine Falcon <em>Falco peregrinus </em>and Western Gull <em>Larus occidentalis </em>in some areas (Nettleship 1996). The Cassinâs Auklet was among the most common prey found in a Bald Eagle nest in California (23 out of 297 birds were of this species) (Erlandsson <em>et al. </em>2007). Reports also include heavy predation by Western Gulls (Thoresen 1964, Manuwal 1979, Nelson 1989) and some predation by Peregrine Falcons. However, the increases in top predator population may also affect the species through non-consumptive effects on ecosystem functions. Surprisingly, Hipfner <em>et al. </em>(2011) found higher breeding success among auklets and puffins on Triangle Island when the falcon eyrie was active, due to the spillover benefits from the falconsâ aggressive and effective defense behaviour in the areas surrounding their own nests.</p>  <p>Human disturbance may also be contributing to reduced reproductive success in parts of the range. Birds whose burrows were closer to foodpaths or villages had a higher rate of nest abandonment and lower breeding success compared to birds nesting further away from settlements and passageways (Albores-Barajas and Soldatini 2011). Although chicks did not show any effect of disturbance in the early stages of growth, chicks in the experimentally disturbed groups stopped gaining weight sooner than undisturbed controls and fledged at lower weights (6 to 9% less) (Albores-Barajas <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>  <p>Bycatch mortality of the species was recorded in the pelagic salmon driftnet fishery in the 1970s and 1980s (Ainley <em>et al. </em>1981) and off British Columbia between 1995 and 2001 (Smith and Morgan 2005), but reduced fishing effort and greater fisheries restrictions have resulted in significant reductions in bycatch of Marbled Murrelet <em>Brachyramphus marmoratus </em>(caught in similar numbers to Cassin's Auklet in previous studies), and is no longer considered a driver of significant decline in that species (Zydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013). As such, it is unlikely that bycatch is impacting the Cassin's Auklet population at greater than a negligible rate.</p>","The total population is estimated to be at least 3,600,000 breeding birds (Nettleship 1996), which equates to approximately 5,400,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species ranges from Baja California (<strong>Mexico</strong>) up the Pacific coast of the <strong>U.S.A.</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong>, through Alaska to the Aleutian Islands (U.S.A.)

Post-breeding adults undergo a flightless wing-moulting period (Fjeldsa 2004) after which they migrate south either singly or in small loose flocks, with concentrations of over 2,000 individuals occurring at favoured staging sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). During the winter the species typically feeds singly and rarely aggregates into flocks (Fjeldsa 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on small (less than 3 ha), shallow (less than 2 m deep) inland waters with abundant emergent vegetation&#160;(e.g. reedbeds),&#160;and stretches of open water, showing a preference for waters in forested areas or in shrub tundra further to the north (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004). Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and coastal lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004). In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fjeldsa 2004) or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004).

The species typically breeds in isolated pairs with more than 50 m between neighbouring nests (Fjeldsa 2004), although in some cases (e.g. on predator-free islands of floating vegetation attached to emergent vegetation beds) semi-colonial nesting may occur (Fjeldsa 2004).","<p>The introduction of large fish, such as the non-native Rainbow Trout, to many inland waterbodies for freshwater fisheries and recreational fishing has resulted in greatly increased resource competition for invertebrate and smaller fish prey (HELCOM Red List 2013). The productivity and suitability of waterbodies used by the species is also thought to be impacted by the expansion of timber plantations throughout the boreal zone, however, the impacts of this are presently unknown. The species is also highly susceptible to bycatch in gillnets, with tens to hundreds caught annually in the Baltic Sea (Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2013). This is considered likely to be the driver of a very rapid decline over the past few decades in the Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011) but represents only a small part of the global wintering range. Bycatch is also a threat in North American coastal waters.</p>  Red-necked Grebes were among the species most severely impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, demonstrating little recovery in numbers within three years (Day <em>et al.</em> 1997). However, its very large range places only a small proportion at risk of direct mortality in a single incident. Persistent organochlorine pollution has been documented to reduce egg viability dramatically in the past, thus greatly reducing reproductive success (De Smet 1987), but bans on the use of such compounds has reduced the threat this poses to populations. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through the effects of agricultural run-off and large-scale freshwater fisheries, the impact of which is unknown. It is considered to be at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to undertaking nocturnal flights and having only low manoeuvrability (Garthe and HÃ¼ppop 2004), although the effect of this on the population has not been quantified. The species has also been recognised as a species of high vulnerability to climate change in a full life-cycle assessment in America (Culp <em>et al.</em> 2017), but actual impacts presently unknown.","The global   population is estimated to number c.190,000-290,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015), while national population estimates include:   c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and   c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; &lt; c.100 breeding pairs, &lt;   c.50 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in   Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 27,700-47,900 pairs, which equates to 55,400-95,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species can be found in western <strong>Canada</strong>, north-west <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, north-east <strong>China</strong> and northern <strong>Japan</strong>, wintering from Japan and <strong>Korea</strong> through the Aleutian Islands to California (both U.S.A.), and off eastern the U.S.A. south to Florida.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is fully migratory, although the extent of migration varies between populations. Some populations, e.g. in Spain, remain predominantly sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Autumn movements are often protracted, with dispersal beginning in mid-August and lasting until late-November (peaking in October). The return migration begins in March (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species's migratory movements are mainly nocturnal, although diurnal migration is known in the Palearctic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds between May and June in the Northern Hemisphere (although laying dates often vary extensively between years and lakes), and nests in reed swamps in colonies of up to 2000 nests, although it may also nest in isolated pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). It forages diurnally (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004) and is highly gregarious, both on migration and during the winter, forming concentrations of hundreds of thousands at certain sites in North America and Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). After arrival at autumn staging grounds (e.g. Mono Lake in California) the species becomes flightless for 3 to 4 months due to loss of weight from the pectoral muscles (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the species frequents permanent and temporary small, shallow, highly eutrophic pools with lush vegetation, such as freshwater marshes and lakes with dispersed submergent vegetation and patches of reeds, as well as ponds and fish ponds, sewage farms, quiet river backwaters and newly flooded areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). In southern Russia and Kazakhstan, it shows a preference for variably developed reed swamps and gypsotrophic lakes (alkaline waters with rich submergent vegetation such as <em>Chara</em> and <em>Potamogeton</em> <em>pectinatus</em>) (FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species moves to salt lakes, hyper-saline industrial evaporation ponds and reservoirs, or to coastal estuaries, arms of the sea, and inshore shallows in bays and channels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004).&#160;<strong>Diet</strong> The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of adult and larval insects (such as aquatic bugs, terrestrial and aquatic beetles, damselflies, dragonflies, midges and brine-flies), molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimps), amphibians (e.g. small frogs and tadpoles), nereid worms, snails and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Konter 2001, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). <strong>Breeding site</strong> It usually nests colonially in thinly spaced, emergent marsh vegetation (such as <em>Scirpus, Typha </em>or sedge <em>Carex</em>), or on dense mats of floating waterweed, sometimes far from the shore (FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic vegetation anchored to emergent vegetation such as reeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004).","Sporadic episodes of catastrophic mortality in the Salton Sea, which have been as large as 150,000 individuals (around 6% of the North American population) in 1991-1992 (Meteyer <em>et al.</em> 2004), appear to be driven by both gradual and episodic reductions in the population of pileworms, the primary prey source available to grebes in the winter (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2007). These reductions are likely due to an increase in salinity of the lake reducing overall pileworm productivity and increasing water column stratification. This results in the production of anoxic conditions with high sulphide levels in deeper water, subsequent weather-mediated mixing events bring this water to the surface, killing pileworms and resulting in the death of grebes too weak to move onto better wintering grounds by starvation (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2007). Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they rebound to previous levels afterwards (Jehl <em>et al.</em> 2002).","The global population is estimated to number c.3,900,000-4,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 46,400-77,500 pairs, which equates to 92,800-155,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species is found on every continent except Australasia and Antarctica.

The species breeds from May onwards in isolated solitary pairs, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the snow melt (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). Adults become flightless for a short time in late-winter when they moult their flight feathers (Godfrey 1979). During winter, the species occurs singly, in pairs or in small loose flocks in marine habitats, occasionally also forming large congregations of c.300 (Godfrey 1979, Snow and Perrins 1998, del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on large, deep freshwater lakes in coniferous forest or on open tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). For nesting, it requires clear water with a visibility of at least 3-4 m and small islands (less than 2.5 ha) (Rimmer 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> It winters along the coast on exposed rocky shores, sheltered bays, channels and sheltered inlets,&#160; preferring shallow inshore waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found inland on lakes and reservoirs during this season, although this is largely influenced by the weather (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, annelid worms, frogs, other amphibians<strong></strong>and plant matter (e.g. <em>Potamogeton</em> spp., willow <em>Salix</em> spp. shoots, roots, seeds, moss and algae) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a mound of plant matter screened by vegetation and placed near the water's edge on islands, islets or promontories (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Relatively high levels of mortality from commercial gillnets have been recorded, e.g. in Chesapeake Bay, 21% of birds killed were this species (Forsell 1999) and bycatch appears relatively frequent in the great lakes, with up to 50 caught in a single net in a week (Evers <em>et al.</em> 2010). This indicates the potential for significant indiscriminate mortality, though this may be an extreme example and efforts to improve fishing gear to reduce this bycatch have been generally effective (Carey 1993). May also be vulnerable to human disturbance and pollution of inland breeding lakes.","Wetlands International (2016) estimated the population at 612,000-640,000 individuals.

However, this is not thought to have a significant impact on the population.","The global population is estimated at c.7,000,000 pairs or 20,000,000 individuals (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2016).

It feeds on krill, small fish, salps and jellyfish (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Heather and Robertson 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","<p>This species is at risk from bycatch throughout its range. It was previously caught in north Pacific drift-nets (Gould <em>et al.</em> 1998), and is still potentially at risk from set-nets. It may be caught on longlines, in trawling operations and on hand and reel lines, but bycatch levels have not been quantified and documented evidence is scarce (Taylor 2000, Tennyson <em>et al.</em> 2012). In recent decades, the Hauraki Gulf has been subject to intensive purse-seine fishing of pelagic fish which has interfered with an important foraging area and may have impacted the species through food resource depletion. Perhaps as a linked effect of this fishery, populations of Red-billed Gulls <em>Larus scopulinus</em> on the Mokohinau Islands have crashed from c.20,000 birds in the 1960s to fewer than 500 birds in 2011 (G. Taylor <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Further investigation is required. In addition, climate change is anticipated to have a significant effect on this species due to its limited range (the population is restricted to an islands with a maximum altitude of 218 m [BirdLife International <em>unpubl. data</em>]), and its observed sensitivity to climatic fluctuations and apparent lower productivity during La NiÃ±a years. The poor breeding success recorded on Aorangi Island in 2011 may have been related to a strong La NiÃ±a event in 2010-2011, but data from some birds fitted with geolocators indicated that incubation shifts were around twice the length of those published in the 1980s (G. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Domestic Pigs <em>Sus domesticus</em> were previously present on Aorangi Island, but eradicated in the 1930s, when the island was declared a reserve.

The species is restricted to two main islands, Aorangi and Tawhiti Rahi, and five other islets and stacks (Marchant and Higgins 1990). In the 1980s, one pair was found breeding on the Simmonds Islands, in the far north of New Zealand (Taylor 2000). Between 1938 and 1981, the population on Aorangi increased from c.200 to c.200,000 pairs (Harper 1983, Heather and Robertson 1997). However, surveys in 2011-13 suggested that there are around 100,000 burrows, similar to estimates from Bartle in 1960s (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2013). In 2011, breeding success on Aorangi Island was noted to be very low, with only 16 chicks found in the 150 burrows sampled (G. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 2012). The total population has been estimated at 2.5 million birds (Marchant and Higgins 1990), although this now regarded as too high (G. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 2012, Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species migrates to the northern Pacific Ocean, from Japan to North America and east to California, and is occasionally found off South America (Heather and Robertson 1997, Taylor 2000).

Hence it is listed as Vulnerable. If invasive species, harvesting of chicks, bycatch in fisheries or other factors are found to be causing population declines, the species might warrant uplisting to Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","<p>Birds arrive at the colonies in early October-November. Eggs are laid in December, with fledging and dispersal in late April-late May (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). On Robinson Crusoe, nesting has been recorded in burrows scattered throughout badly eroded, generally sparsely vegetated but occasionally forested habitat at elevations of 50-390 m. On Santa Clara, the species breeds in scattered colonies in eroded terrain at elevations from 15-300m (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). On Isla Mocha, the colony is in forest (predominant tree <em>Aextoxicon punctatum</em>), with the highest burrow densities along mountain ridges and between the roots of old-growth trees up to 390 m (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It feeds primarily in offshore waters over the continental shelf but also in pelagic waters (Hodum<em> et al.</em> 2004), mostly on fish (sardines <em>Strangomera bentincki</em> and anchovies <em>Engraulis ringens</em> [<span lang=""EN-CA"">Guicking <em>et al</em>. 2001]), squid and to a lesser extent, crustaceans (D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Birds breeding on Santa Clara demonstrate a diet dominated by fish, with squid comprising a smaller proportion of the diet (CEC 2005).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Interactions with fisheries potentially poses a major threat to this species (Guicking <em>et al</em>. 2001, CEC 2005, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2012). Birds have been found entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking<em> et al. </em> 1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2012). The distribution of longline commercial fishing activities overlap both spatially and temporally with the speciesâ wintering range over the continental shelf of North America, making the risk of interacting with the fishing fleet highly likely (CEC 2005). Bycatch mortality has been recorded in artisanal fisheries off the coast of Ecuador and Peru (Mangel 2012) which are poorly regulated and consist of a considerable number of small longline vessels whose overall impact may exceed that of large-scale fisheries. In Chile, capture by small vessels represents at least 76% of the overall bycatch of this species (Suazo <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016).</p>  <p>Predation by cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Coatimundis <em>Nasua nasua</em> on Robinson Crusoe, and cats and dogs <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em> on Mocha (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999) represents another significant threat. The population of coatimundi appears to have declined from historical levels on Robinson Crusoe but predation is still being documented (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). On Isla Mocha, burrows excavated by dogs have been found, but there is no evidence of significant predation occurring (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). European Rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> compete with shearwaters for burrows on Robinson Crusoe but were eradicated from Santa Clara in 2003 with a resultant 40% increase in the proportion of burrows occupied by breeding pairs (Hodum <em>et al</em>. 2017). Soil erosion by goats <em>Capra aegagrus hireus</em> and rabbits affects populations on Robinson Crusoe (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt</em>. 1999). At present, due to the highly restricted distribution of goats on the island, their impacts are minimal, in contrast to the pervasive presence of rabbits in all breeding colonies on Robinson Crusoe (P. Hodum <em>pers. comm</em>.). Cattle <em>Bos taurus</em> in one colony on Robinson Crusoe cause soil erosion and burrow collapses, but the core area of the colony is protected by a cattle-proof fence (Gladics and Hodum 2010); yet, cattle still impact burrows outside this area, although to a lesser extent (P. Hodum <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Both House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> occur on Isla Mocha and Robinson Crusoe, but their impacts are unknown (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). Stable isotope analyses of rat tissue suggest they are feeding at lower, terrestrial trophic levels, and no evidence has been found of eggs or chicks consumed by rats in burrows (P. Hodum <em>in litt.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Chicks are harvested by islanders on Mocha in the fledgling season (March-May), with an estimated 20% of all chicks (3000-5000) taken in 1998 (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, CEC 2005). More recently, due to enforcement of the prohibition of chick harvest begun in 2011, the magnitude of the chick harvest has decreased considerably, but illegal poaching still seems to occur most years (ACAP 2018). Quantitative estimates of harvest rates are difficult to obtain (P. Hodum <em>pers. comm</em>.). In 2018, illegal hunting was reported from Isla Mocha with c. 300 individuals killed in one incident (ACAP 2018).</p>  Plastic ingestion is widespread in the species, but there is no indication of what impact this currently has, or will have over the next three generations at either the individual or population level (P.

Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999]) off the coast of Arauco, <strong>Chile</strong>. Recent evidence suggests a small colony on Isla Santa Maria in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). These sites combined indicate around 30,000 breeding pairs, which would imply a maximum of 100,000 individuals (Brooke 2004). Following breeding, the species disperses northward along the west coast of South America towards North America (CEC 2005). There are also isolated records during the non-breeding period in Chilean Patagonia (Imberti 2005, C.G. Suazo <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The migration is evident by its increasing presence along the continental shelf from the Gulf of California in Mexico to British Columbia in Canada, during April and May each year. Numbers peak between August and October, followed by a rapid decline in November, as birds return to their breeding colonies (CEC 2005). Based on ship-based observations, and satellite tracking, <em>Ardenna creatopus</em> ranges from the northern Gulf of Alaska (from approximately 59.87Âº N) to southern Chile (to roughly 50.00Âº S); primarily over the continental shelf and slope regions (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2012 <em>in </em>ACAP 2013). A specimen has also been taken from the Atlantic coast of Argentina (Mazar Barnett and Navas 1998) and there are records from New Zealand and Australia (Patterson 1991, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Despite probable declines in the past, populations in the Juan FernÃ¡ndez group appear to have been more or less stable over the past 15 years (CEC 2005, P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>), although the breeding population on Santa Clara Island increased by 40% following the eradication of European rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) from the island in 2003 (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>). In contrast, populations on Isla Mocha may be declining owing to the effects of chick harvesting (CEC 2005), although breeding season monitoring between 2010-2016 suggested a stable population during that time (P. Hodum <em>unpubl. data</em>).&#160;Birds have been entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, D. Guicking and P. H.

The distribution of breeding colonies on Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara was determined in 2002-2006 and resurveyed in 2016, while Mocha was surveyed in 2009 and again in 2016. The colony on Mocha is within a national reserve, which has had a management plan since 1998 and two reserve guards (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999, J. C. Torres-Mura <em>in litt.</em> 1999). Harvesting of chicks is illegal under Chilean law (Guicking <em> et al. </em>1999),<strong> </strong>although this was unenforced until 2011. Since 2011, the park guards have worked with the federal police to enforce the prohibition on chick harvesting. In Canada, <em>Ardenna creatopus</em> was assessed as Threatened in 2004 (COSEWIC 2013). In 2005, the CEC published the North American Conservation Action Plan for the species (CEC 2005). In 2008, Canada released a recovery strategy for <em>Ardenna creatopus</em> (EC 2008). Oikonos Ecosystem Knowledge has worked on the Juan FernÃ¡ndez Archipelago since the 2001â2002 breeding season, monitoring annual reproductive success and predation rates, evaluating threats to the population, and undertaking conservation actions such as the construction of fences to exclude cattle and predatory mammals from colonies, and the restoration of colonies through planting of native plant species within protective exclosures (P.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Breeding occurs mainly on coastal islands, typically in areas of grassland or other vegetation, but sometimes cliffs or bare ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Whilst breeding, the species alternates short foraging trips to local waters with long foraging trips (up to 17 days) to the Polar Frontal Zone. Short trips allow greater chick provisioning at the sacrifice of body condition, which is then recovered in richer sub-Antarctic waters. Diet includes fish (particularly mycotphids), crustaceans and squid (Weimerskirch and Cherel 1998). Feeding occurs in flocks of up to 20,000 birds, and it has been seen in association with cetaceans. &#160;It is a trans-equatorial migrant, wintering off Aleutian Islands, some moving north of Bering Strait (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992).","<p>The species suffered substantial mortality from entanglement in gill nets set for salmon in the Northern Pacific, particularly off Japan with c. 40,000 birds captured per annum (DeGange and Day 1991, Uhlmann 2003).

Birds begin to arrive at the main colony on Torishima Island in early October. A single egg is laid in late October to late November and incubation lasts 64 to 65 days. Hatching occurs in late December through January. Chicks begin to fledge in late May into June. There is little information on timing of breeding on Minami-kojima. First breeding sometimes occurs when birds are five years old, but more commonly when birds are aged six. It forages diurnally and potentially nocturnally, either singly or in groups primarily taking prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). During the breeding season, individuals nesting off Japan forage over the continental shelf (Kiyota and Minami 2008). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding. </em>Historically, it preferred level, open, areas adjacent to tall clumps of the grass <em>Miscanthus sinensis</em> for nesting.<strong> Diet</strong> It feeds mainly on squid, but also takes shrimp, fish, flying fish eggs and other crustaceans (ACAP 2009). It is routinely attracted to fishing vessels, where it feeds on discards, fish offal and regrettably also occasionally on baited hooks.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Historical declines were driven by exploitation, the species being targeted primarily for its feathers, but also eggs and oil (ACAP 2009). Today, the main threat is posed by commercial fisheries. The speciesâ distribution overlaps with fisheries that occur in the shallower waters along continental shelf break and slope regions, e.g., Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em> and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus</em> <em>stenolepis</em> longline fisheries off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia (Guy <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is known to be killed in U.S. and Russian longline fisheries for Pacific Cod <em>Gadus</em> <em>microcephalus</em> and halibut. Since 1983, a total of 15 birds have been reported killed by fishing gear (USFWS 2012), but it is widely considered that the actual mortality from bycatch is considerably higher (USFWS 2008, COSEWIC 2013). Although there have been no reports of this species being taken in demersal longline fisheries in British Columbia, it has been suggested that one to two birds could be taken each year (COSEWIC 2013). Birds on Torishima have been observed with swallowed hooks that can be traced back to the Japanese fisheries that operate near the island (ACAP 2009). Other threats include mortality and habitat loss from the active volcano on Torishima, typhoons and potential oil spills (G.R. Balogh <em>in litt.</em> 2008). Models have shown that even small increases in chronic mortality rates, such as those resulting from bycatch, would have a greater impact on population trend than stochastic and theoretically catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>At the end of the 2013-2014 breeding season, the global population was estimated to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on the two islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds on Ogasawara Islands.&#160;Eda <em>et al</em>. (2012) showed that two populations of <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> <span lang=""EN-US"">existed about 1,000 years ago and suggested that descendants of each population have segregated breeding colonies on Torishima and on the two islands in the East China Sea. The sequence divergence between the two clades is greater than between other Diomedeidae sister species (Eda and Higuchi 2012). The trend of assortative mating was indicated among birds from the Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> breeds on Torishima in the western Pacific and Minami-kojima and Kita-kojima in the East China Sea in <strong>Japan</strong>. Historically, there are believed to have been at least nine colonies south of Japan and in the East China Sea (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006). Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, the Aleutians and Alaska (to <strong>U.S.A.</strong>) (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006, Suryan <em>et al.</em> 2007). The species has also been encountered as far north as the Chukchi Sea (Day <em>et al.</em> 2013). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore off Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan <em>et al.</em> 2007). Juveniles have been shown to travel twice the distances per day and spend more time within continental shelf habitat than adult birds (Suryan <em>et al</em>. 2008). The species declined dramatically during the 19th and 20th centuries owing to exploitation for feathers, and was believed extinct in 1949, but it was rediscovered in 1951. The current population is estimated, via direct counts and modelling based on productivity data, to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on 2 islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds in Ogasawara Islands (Japan) (H. Hasegawa <em>in litt. </em>2014, Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). In 1954, 25 birds (including at least six pairs) were present on Torishima. Given that there are now 650 breeding pairs on Torishima (H. Hasegawa <em>in litt. </em>2014), the species has undergone an enormous increase since its rediscovery and the onset of conservation efforts. In Ogasawara Islands, a historic breeding site, one nesting pair has been observed on Mukojima in 2013 and one chick was produced in 2016 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another pair was observed on Nakoudojima in 2014 and 2015 and one chick was produced in 2014 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). In 2016, one additional unidentified pair produced a chick on Yomejima. In addition, in 2010, one nesting pair was observed on Kure Atoll (Hawaii), but was probably two females and thus, unsuccessful, and one chick was produced on Midway Atoll (M. Naughton pers. comm. 2011).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong>In 2001 and 2007, respectively, the USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of tori (streamer) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish, and rockfish&#160;<em>Sebastes</em> spp. longline fisheries on Canadaâs west coast (DFO 2007). In 2003, the Committee on the Conservation of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> as Threatened in Canada (COSEWIC 2003); and in 2005, the species was added to Schedule 1 of Canadaâs Species at Risk Act, as Threatened (EC 2008). In 2008, Canada and the USA released final recovery strategies for the species (EC 2008, USFWS 2008); and in 2013, <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> was re-assessed by COSEWIC; and once again it was listed as Threatened (COSEWIC 2013).&#160;Mitigation measures have been established in the Alaska demersal longline fishery and in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery (NOAA 2008). Streamer lines (both heavy weight lines for large boats and lightweight lines for smaller vessels) have been designed to keep birds from longline hooks as they are set, and these are being distributed free of charge to the Alaskan longline fleet (USFWS 2008), though they are not deployed in near-shore waters. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure which requires large tuna and swordfish longline vessels (&gt;24m long) to use a combination of two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North. Torishima has been established as a National Wildlife Protection Area and National Special Natural Monument. In 1981-1982, native plants were transplanted into the Torishima nesting colony in order to stabilise the nesting habitat and the nest structures. This has enhanced breeding success, with over 60% of eggs now resulting in fledged young. Decoys have been used to attract birds to nest at another site on Torishima since 1993 and the first pair started breeding at this new site in November 1995. The number of chicks fledged from this new colony has increased from one chick in 2004 to four chicks in 2005, 13 chicks in 2006 and 16 chicks in 2007. In October-November 2007, 35 eggs were laid at this new site (Sato<em> </em>2009). To expedite new colony establishment, in 2007, the Japanese government approved a project that chicks translocated from Torishima were hand-reared on a non-volcanic and former breeding island, Mukojima, 350 km away, (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2012). From 2008-2012, 70 chicks were translocated and 69 chicks successfully fledged (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). 27 hand-reared birds returned to Mukojima at least once per breeding season from 2011-2016 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Two hand-reared birds successfully paired with naturally reared birds and fledged two chicks at Mukojima and neighbouring island, Nakodojima, 5 km away, during this period (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed&#160;</strong>Continue to promote measures designed to protect this species from becoming hooked or entangled by commercial fishing gear. Promote conservation measures for the population of two islands in the East China Sea. Promote taxonomic re-evaluation through comparative studies of morphological, genetic, ecological, and ethological traits of birds on Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Continue research into the at-sea distribution and marine habitat use through satellite telemetry studies.

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After mating (from June onwards), males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period (Kear 2005). Large flocks of several hundred to a thousand (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals can be observed during winter (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea (Kear 2005) or shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m [Scott and Rose 1996]) with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps [Johnsgard 1978]), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods (Kear 2005) and insects&#160;(e.g. midges and caddisflies [del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992]) as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005).</p>    <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005).

It occasionally nests in association with gull or tern colonies<strong> </strong>(Kear 2005). Non-breeding birds spend the breeding season in flocks on open water (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). After breeding (from June onwards [Scott and Rose 1996]) the adults migrate to moulting sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(males travelling and moulting before the females) (Madge and Burn 1988), where they become flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996). When moulting and overwintering the species is highly sociable and can occur in large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996) of several thousands of individuals (Scott and Rose 1996), although it is more common in small scattered groups of c.100 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on wooded<strong><sup> </sup></strong>coastlines (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), small freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), pools and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in northern coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), wooded Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and alpine zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005); especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and low trees (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The majority winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds (Snow and Perrins 1998).

The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes<strong> </strong>(Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away) (Kear 2005).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Hunting poses a significant threat to the species, with an estimated harvest of 6,000 â 14,000 individuals in the 10-year period from 2004-2014 in US and Canada, but with a downward trend (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). A recent estimate suggests that the harvest of White-winged Scoters may be 29-37% over the maximum sustainable rate (Koneff <em>et al.</em> 2017).  </p><p>The species feeds at depths of 30â40 m and is therefore highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets, as documented by Good <em>et al.</em> (2009) in the Salient Sea, Washington. Moulting and wintering populations are also vulnerable to oil spills as they often occur in high densities in close proximity to oil transportation routes. One catastrophic spill could impact a large proportion of the population. Oil pollution can also cause the long-term disruption of food supplies which may have more serious effects on populations in the long-term than direct mortality from oiling. Lance (2001) documented evidence for a long-term negative effect as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident. The disturbance and habitat degradation caused by increasing levels of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic will likely have only minor or negligible impacts on this species (Poland <em>et al. </em>2003, Henderson and Loe 2014). </p>  <p>In some locations in the Pacific Northwest, sea ducks could be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium associated with mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, which raises the possibility that such exposure could be contributing to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). Climate change is an additional threat, with remote sensing showing the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006), with these wetlands providing important breeding grounds for the species at present. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch, projected to cause a 31.0% population decline between 1980 and 2080 (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Clutches normally consist of four to six eggs (Craig and Feare 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Common Starling is omnivorous, taking animal and plant material all year round, but during the spring animal food predominates and is fed almost exclusively to nestlings (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>The northern and eastern populations are migratory, whereas southern and western populations as well as those in urban areas tend to be resident (Craig and Feare 2015).","The species is thought to be declining in some areas owing to the intensification and specialization of agriculture and subsequent changes in rural habitats (Craig and Feare 2015), such as decreases in fallow and grassland and increases in autumn-sown arable crops (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

It prefers open country, such as farmland where buildings provide nesting sites and where water is nearby. It is primarily a rural species in Europe and North America, whilst in north Africa and Asia it often breeds in towns and cities (Turner and Christie 2012). In Europe, it is superseded by the House Martin (<em>Delichon urbicum</em>) in urban areas (Turner and Rose 1989).&#160;<br/><br/>The breeding season lasts from May to August. The nest is built by both sexes and is a cup or half-cup, made from mud pellets mixed with fibres such as dry grass, straw and horsehair and lined with dry grass and white feathers. Originally, nests were built in caves or on cliffs, but now almost always on artificial structures. Clutches consist of two to seven eggs (Turner and Christie 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Barn Swallow feeds almost entirely on flying insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, with European birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), although some individuals winter in southern and western Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds breeding in North America winter in South America, whilst birds breeding in East Asia winter in South Asia (Turner and Christie 2012).","The main threat to the species is the intensification of agriculture. Changes in farming practices, such as the abandonment of traditional milk and beef production, have resulted in a loss of suitable foraging areas. In addition, intensive livestock rearing, land drainage and the use of herbicides and pesticides all reduce the numbers of insect prey available. Suitable nest sites are often scarcer on modern farms. The species is susceptible to changes in climate, with bad weather in the wintering areas as well as the breeding grounds affecting breeding success (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is occasionally hunted for sport, and nests are sometimes removed as a nuisance. In North America, introduced House Sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) are serious nest-site competitors, taking over nests and destroying eggs and nestlings (Turner and Christie 2012).","The European population&#160;is estimated at 29-48.7 million pairs, which equates to 58-97.4 million mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Europe forms approximately 20% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 290-487 million mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Throughout its range, it prefers mainly barren terrain with very short vegetation. In Eurasia, it breeds mainly in arctic tundra, dry stony patches in lichen tundra, barren steppes and arctic-alpine zones. It also occupies open coasts and dunes in the non-breeding season. In western Europe, migrants of the subspecies<em> flava&#160;</em>are largely confined to open coastal habitats around the North Sea in winter. In North America, Horned Lark is widely distributed across most open habitats from sea-level up to c.4,000 m. In the Andes, the subspecies <em>peregrina</em> uses short-grass pastureland and bare fields to at least 3,100 m. <br/>In Eurasia, Horned Lark breeds from late May to mid-July in Scandinavia, but from mid-June in Arctic Russia. In North America, it breeds from mid-February in southern USA and from mid-May in the Canadian Arctic. The female builds the nest in an excavated cavity or natural depression on the ground, which is filled with woven plant material, lined with feathers or other fine material and has stones, bark, clods of earth, animal dung and other materials placed around it. The nest is usually positioned to reduce wind flow across it to as little as a tenth of ambient wind speed and to maximize shade. Clutches consist of one to eight eggs, but mostly two to five, although clutch size increases with latitude. <br/>Horned Lark feeds on a wide range of invertebrates in summer and plant material in winter. Nestlings are fed almost entirely with invertebrates. <br/>The species is migratory or partially migratory in the north and mostly resident or an altitudinal migrant in the south. Across the Holarctic Region, subspecies in the far north are wholly migratory, with much or all of breeding range abandoned in winter. In the south of the range, Horned Lark is an altitudinal migrant (Donald and de Juana 2014).","In Europe, drastic declines were noted since 1950s in northern Fennoscandia, especially Finland, which were believed to be due to overgrazing of lichen by reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (Donald and de Juana 2014). The subspecies <em>peregrina </em>in the Colombian Andes is threatened by the introduced Kikuyu Grass (<em>Cenchrus clandestinus</em>), unfavourable agricultural practices and unrestricted use of pesticides. In North America, changes in agriculture are considered a threat, including the replacement of arable crops by biomass-fuel production and the change from conventional tillage to minimum tillage. Agricultural abandonment and direct poisoning by pesticides are also considered threats (Donald and de Juana 2014).","Partners in Flight estimate the global population to number 140,000,000 mature individuals (A.

142396828,55997823,Cervus canadensis,Least Concern,,2018,2015-01-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Until recently this species was considered a subspecies of <em>Cervus elaphus </em>and thus not evaluated on the IUCN Red List. This species is listed as Least Concern due to a wide distribution and presumed large populations. There have been range contractions and presumably population declines in some parts of the species' range both in Asia and North America, but overall it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in three generations). The species may in fact be increasing globally.","It inhabits open deciduous woodland, the boreal forests of Siberia, upland moors and open mountainous areas (sometimes above the treeline), natural grasslands, pastures and meadows (Mattioli 2011). In woodland, its diet consists mainly of shrub and tree shoots, but in other habitats it also consumes grasses, sedges and shrubs.<br/><br/>Generally found in mountainous regions, where it spends summers in alpine meadows and winters in valleys. On more level terrain, seeks wooded hillsides in summer, open grasslands in winter. In the USA, Pacific coast populations are more sedentary than are those elsewhere. Migrates from areas with deep snow. Some individuals in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, migrate up to 97 kilometers annually (Adams 1982). In the Altai and Sayan Mountains seasonal migration may be up to 140 km (Mattioli 2011).<br/><br/>Bushes and trees are critical for protection from predators such as wolves, and as an important source of food during the winter in the form of browse (Chen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998). During the September-October rut, Mongolian populations congregate in large groups and are more often found in open lowland areas (Dulamtseren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989).<br/><br/>Found in China up to 5,000 m, animals come lower into valleys in winter. They live in small herds of females and young, gathering into larger herds in winter. Stags live singly or form all male herds in summer, but gather harems in rut season in late summer, without obvious territories. Natural lifespan is about 17-18 years. Calving occurs in May-June following a gestation of 247 days. Females drop single calves in late spring. Young are mature at 1.5-2.5 years.","In many areas hunting is strictly regulated on this species and harvests are used to control population growth as large predators have been removed or ""controlled"" over much of the range. Overhunting and habitat loss as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanisation are other pressures (Wemmer 1998) in some areas and for some subspecies, but they are not thought to pose a major threat to the species at present.<br/><br/>In Mongolia, this species is primarily targeted for its antler velvet, which is highly valued in traditional medicines, with a market value of $60-100 USD per kg of antlers. Other body parts, including male genital organs, foetuses and female tails, are also valued for traditional medicines and have similar market values (Zahler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The resulting illegal and unsustainable hunting has caused a 92% population decline over the past 18 years (Zahler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). Habitat loss and fragmentation, and human disturbance resulting from mining activities and infrastructure development, also constitute threats to some extent. Trophy hunters can purchase hunting licenses from which $1,170 USD is allocated to the government (MNE 2005).<br/><br/>In China the species is subject to heavy poaching (Gu Jinghe pers. comm.) (Xuchang and Minghai 2007). Antlers, tendons, unborn fawns, male reproductive organs, and tails from <em>C. e. yarkandensis</em> fetch a high price on local markets for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Current market prices for these products are increasing rapidly. Young deer are sold as stud for deer farming projects (Gu Jinghe 1991).<br/><br/>In Russia, the number of<em> C. elaphus</em> and <em>C. canadensis</em> harvested by legal hunting represents 8% of their populations. The quotas for legal hunting remain higher than the number actually hunted in all regions, the percentage of quotas reached for legally hunted deer were 70% for <em>Cervus elaphus</em>, 50% for <em>C. c. sibiricus</em> and 60% for <em>C. c. xanthopygus</em> (Mosheva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Major threats to the species in Russia include forest fires, illegal logging (especially of Siberian Pine) and poaching, the meat and antler velvet is used by oriental traditional medicine (O. Pereladova pers. comm.).","It is a widespread and abundant species across much of its current  range, although there is increasing fragmentation of populations in the  western USA and Canada, and the species has been lost from some areas.  In portions of North America where predators have been removed the  species is common and populations are managed by recreational hunting.  In the late 1990s the population was estimated at about one million  (Mattioli 2011) and Wapiti have been declared âoverabundantâ in many  jurisdictions harbouring the species (Crete and Daigle 1999). Typical  population densities range from 2 to 10 individuals per kmÂ² (up to c. 25  per kmÂ², higher figures in the literature almost certainly refer to fed  populations: S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). It is sufficiently abundant  in some areas to be considered a pest in forestry plantations. Annual  harvest in N America is around 200,000 individuals (Mattioli 2011).  Californian Wapiti known as âTule Elkâ had dropped to 2-5 individuals in  1875, strict protection and transplants resulted in population  recovery, numbering 3,900 individuals in 22 herds in 2010 (Wilson and  Mittermeier 2011, Williams <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004).<br/><br/>In China,<em> C. c. alashanicus</em>  occurs in the Alashan Mountains of southeastern Inner Mongolia  (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990). In the late 1990s there were 8,000-10,000 deer  in Mongolia. <em>C. c. sibiricus</em> occurs in the Tien Shan, N Xinjiang. The status of the species in northern China is unknown (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). <br/><br/>The status of MacNeill's Red Deer (<em>C. c. macneilli</em>), in central and southwest China, is unknown (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). The Shou (<em>C. c. wallichii</em>)  was considered extinct and rediscovered in a few locations in southeast  Tibet (Xizang) in 1995, it also occurs in Bhutan (Wilson and  Mittermeier 2011).<br/><br/>In the 1980s the population size of<em> C. c. sibiricus </em>in Russia was estimated at 32,000 individuals and that of<em> C. c. xanthopygus</em>  as 51,000 individuals. In the late 1990s the estimates were 43,000 and  126,000 individuals for both subspecies respectively (Baskin and Danell  2003). Although the populations of both subspecies are increasing, the  differences in the population estimates between the 1980s and the 1990s  may be due mostly to the utilisation of different methods (Danilkin  1999, Danilkin 2006).<br/><br/>In 2010, the population of <em>C.c.xanthopygus</em>  was around 60,000 individuals. Most (35,000) inhabit the Primorsky and  Khabarovsky regions, where it remains stable. In the Amursky region the  population is estimated at 14,000 individuals and in Respublika Sakha  (Yakutia) aproximately 5,000 individuals. On the Sakhalin peninsula the  deer were reintroduced in the 1960s. Their numbers reached a peak in the  1990s when more than 700 individuals were counted. Due to illegal  hunting the population declined sharply since then to less than 200  individuals in 2010 (Mosheva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Since 2010 the population of <em>C.c. sibiricus</em> in Russia has remained stable at 33,000-39,000 individuals. <em>C.c. xanthopygus</em> increased to 150,000 individuals in 2012 but decreased slightly in 2013 (J. PluhÃ¡Äek pers. comm. 2015).",Increasing,"The Wapiti has a distribution extending from central Asia (northeast Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Altai), through Siberia, north China, central and southwest China, Bhutan, northern Mongolia, Manchuria and Ussuriland to North America (Corbet 1978, Koubek and Zima 1999, Wilson and Ruff 1999). It occurs from sea level to above the tree line (c. 3,300 m). The distribution is much more patchy and fragmented than the apparent continuity suggested by the distribution map. <br/><br/>In central Asia, it is found in the Altai Mountains of northeast Kazakhstan, the Tian Shan Mountains of east Kyrgyzstan, east to Siberia, Mongolia, and W and N China. It is found regionally in Mongolia in HÃ¶vsgÃ¶l, Hangai, Hentii, Ikh Hyangan, Mongol-Altai and Govi Altai mountain ranges, it was reintroduced into open hills in south-eastern parts of its range (Sokolov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1982, Dulamtseren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1989). In China, specifically, it is found in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, Manchuria, Ninxia, SE Xizang, N Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, W Sichuan and E Xizang. In Russia, it inhabits almost all regions eastwards from Omskaya Oblast in the Siberian Federal District and the Far East Federal District. It is introduced in New Zealand and Italy (preserve of La Mandria, at Venaria Reale near Torino: Maschietti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1988). There is also literary evidence for the attempted introduction (20 June 1890) of the species in the Mesola wood, in the Po delta (Masseti 2003).",In China the species is subject to heavy poaching (Gu Jinghe pers. comm.) (Xuchang and Minghai 2007). It is illigally hunted for antler velvet (traditional medicines) and other body parts ($60-100 per kg of antlers in Mongolia and similar values for other parts).,Terrestrial,"It occurs in numerous protected areas across its range.<br/><br/><em>C. c. sibiricus</em> is farmed in Russia for its velvet which mitigates hunting pressure on wild populations (O. Pereladova pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Williams <em>et al.</em> (2004) caution that there is a high potential for inbreeding and loss of genetic variation within Tule Elk (<em>C.c. nannodes</em>) herds that are maintained at small size and without gene flow, and suggest that management strategies involving transplants would be the most beneficial in terms of maintaining nuclear variation within the subspecies.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
143831586,183347,Sardinops sagax,Least Concern,,2018,2018-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Sardinops sagax</em>&#160;has a wide anti-tropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations. It is a highly commercial species throughout much of its range and supports some of the largest global fisheries. Data from available assessments  (spawning stock biomass, survey catch rates, landings data, etc.) show some indication of decline over the past 10 years (3 generation lengths); however, this species naturally exhibits large and drastic fluctuations which can be attributed to long-term, regional climatic and environmental conditions and therefore, it is difficult to infer declines based on the available time series. Although this species abundance is currently at historic lows in some regions (e.g., the U.S.; southern Africa; and Japan), it appears to be moderately exploited and is well managed throughout its global range. Therefore, <em>Sardinops sagax</em> is globally assessed as Least Concern. However, overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during periods of high abundance, which can result in extended periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions in areas which generally have viable fisheries. This risk, identified over decades of research and monitoring of the world's major <em>S. sagax</em> fisheries, is now well recognized by regulators and managed accordingly, though localized caution is warranted in areas with consistently high fishing pressure.","<p>This is a marine, pelagic and migratory species forming large shoals that may spread over several kilometres (Whitehead 1985). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of sardine stocks associated with changes in population size show a similar pattern in all subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009) and are thought to be closely influenced by prevailing winds, currents and local phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations (Munroe 2016). For example, spawning grounds have been completely abandoned as subpopulations decrease in size, or colonized as the subpopulation size increases, or both (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). Similarly, the diets of all five subpopulations show some variation but are generally similar throughout; this species primarily feeds on zooplankton, mostly small crustaceans (i.e., copepods, ostracods, euphausiids and mysids), but also feeds on mollusc larvae and phytoplankton (i.e., diatoms: Whitehead 1985). Individuals reach maturity between 1 â 2 years of age; it is thought that a majority spawn at age 2 (Whitehead 1985). Spawning changes geographically within and between regions but is generally in the winter and spring months of the geographic region with the period extending into summer months in some regions (e.g., off Australia and New Zealand: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>Geographic variations in some biological characteristics have also been observed within and between subpopulations, such as maximum size, longevity and depth, as well as preferred spawning habitat. In general, this species is known to a maximum of 36 cm standard length, but is more commonly found to be about 18 - 25 cm; subpopulations in the eastern Pacific are typically larger than the others (Whitehead 1985). Funamoto (2018) reports the subpopulation in the northwestern Pacific (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum longevity of 7 years; Whitehead (1985) reported the northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has a maximum longevity of about 25 years. This species is known from depths up to 40 â 200 m (Whitehead 1985, Munroe 2016). Available information related to spawning habitat from each geographically separated subpopulation is variable, but suggests that this species uses either inshore (bays and coastal waters) and/or offshore (~ 80 km offshore with depths up to 5,000 m) areas to spawn (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al.</em> 2007). </p>    <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>  <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has the longest estimated maximum longevity (20 â 25 years) and the largest measured maximum standard length (36 cm), but is usually found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation mainly matures within 1 - 2 years and breeds in late winter to early summer months (January â June) with peak spawning in April â May (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation migrates northward during summer months between California and British Columbian waters, and returns southward in autumn and winter months to spawn off the southern California coast (~ 80 km offshore), between the Point of Conception and San Diego (Whitehead 1985), possibly extending to southern Baja, California (Kramer 1970, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Spawning takes place during the night and individuals produce pelagic eggs (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is known to a maximum standard length of 30 cm, but is more commonly found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This species can be found down to depths of at least 40 m (Whitehead 1985). It is known to breed twice in one season (at least off Chile), mostly between July â September (Whitehead 1985). The spawning period can extend between February â March, though this is less common (Whitehead 1985). This species forms large schools in the Peru Current (Whitehead 1985). Large southward geographical range shifts of this subpopulation have been observed in association with El NiÃ±o event (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Evidence available from years not affected by El NiÃ±o events suggest an abundance of sardines in northern Chile have a seasonal pattern, with peak abundances occurring during the winter spawning season and much lower abundances during summer and fall (Serra and Tsukayama 1988, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>    <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 32 cm based on an individual collected from the Shimane Prefecture, Japan (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018), but is more commonly found to 15 â 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). Individuals in this region reach maturity at age 2 and breed in winter and spring months from about November to the beginning of May; in the southern portion of the northwestern Pacific range, this species spawns in the earlier months of the spawning period (Whitehead 1985). Peak spawning is thought to take place in February (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007); eggs are most abundant between February and March (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). Spawning mainly takes place along the Pacific coast of Japan and has been observed inshore in protected bays, in the surface waters of open seas and in offshore waters over bottom depth of up to 5,000 m (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). This migratory species tends to move northward and inshore in the summer months, returning southward and more offshore in the winter months (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 21.3 cm, but is more commonly found to 18 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation reaches maturity between 8 â 13 cm standard length throughout most of its range; individuals off New Zealand are reported to reach maturity at 12 cm SL or above (Whitehead 1985). It is thought that the subpopulation off Australia breeds throughout its entire geographical range, but at different times (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989); in the southern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the spring and summer months (September â February), whereas in the northern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the winter months (June â August: Whitehead 1985). In contrast, off New Zealand spawning is concentrated in the area between the North and South Islands (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). This species forms large school at the surface during the spawning periods and when juveniles leave sheltered bays to join adult schools (i.e., southern New South Wales: Whitehead 1985). </p>    The southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus </em>or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is known to maximum standard length of 28 cm, but is more commonly found to 25 cm (Whitehead 1985). This is a highly migratory species (though the northern stock perhaps rarely moves south of the Orange River) that prefers the cooler, coastal waters of the southwestern African shelf (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation primarily spawns between September â April and is known to breed either offshore (January â March) or inshore (September â December: Munroe 2016).","The larger subpopulations of this species seem to naturally undergo drastic population fluctuations due to inter-annual, annual and long-term climactic changes resulting in large range contractions and expansions over time (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of subpopulations show a similar pattern in each isolated region where this species has been heavily exploited (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Barange <em>et al. </em>2009); overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during times of high abundance. Periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions result in fishery collapse in areas which generally have viable fisheries (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Given this species has an anti-tropical geographical distribution and prefers cooler waters, a global increase in average sea surface temperature (SST) may result in prolonged or permanent range contractions in all isolated regions, though more research is needed to determine the extent this may affect this species.","Landings of <em>Sardinops sagax</em> are reported to the FAO as three nominal species: <em>S. sagax</em>, which represents subpopulations off Australia, and in the eastern Pacific off the western coasts of North and South America; <em>S. ocellatus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off South Africa; and <em>S. melanostictus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off Japan. Globally, combined landings of the three nominal species average just over 6.5 million tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 with a peak of 25 million tonnes in 1985 (FAO 2016). Catch reconstructions are available for <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (1950 - 2010) which appear to encompass global catches and report lower annual catches, averaging just over 3.7 million tonnes annually, but otherwise track very closely with landings reported to the FAO (Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches show a sharp increasing trend between 1970 and the mid-1980s followed by peak landings between about 1984 - 1988; a maximum of about 25 million tonnes was reported to the FAO in 1985 (FAO 2016). Following 1988, landings and reconstructed catches declined to quantities similar to historical values (&lt; 5 million tonnes) by the late 1990s, and continued to decline below historical catches until the end of the available time series (2010 for reconstructed catches and 2014 for reported landings: FAO 2016, Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>According to Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), previous theoretical considerations and attempts to find discrete genetic stocks suggest it is unlikely that this species can be subdivided into genetically definable stocks within the individual current systems. However, more recent work has been completed (e.g., Schwartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999, Miller 2006, Ohshimo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Roux <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160; Demer and Zwolinski 2014, van der Lingen <em>et al. </em>2015, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) to suggest otherwise; at least two or three stocks are recognized in each current system where this species occurs (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Subpopulation-specific information</strong><br/><em><br/>Northeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (northern Mexico to southern Alaska), southern (Baja Peninsula  to southern California) and Gulf of California (Baldwin <em>et al. </em>2012,  Demer and Zwolinski 2014, Izzo<em> et al.</em> 2017). The northern and southern units appear to move north and south along the coast in  synchrony, but spawn in separate localities and seasons (Garcia-marales  <em>et al.</em> 2012, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an important commercial fishery for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Current subpopulation information is limited. Previously, the subpopulation collapsed in the 1950s and early 1960s resulting in a large contraction of its geographical range; it was virtually absent from waters north of Point Conception (34Â°N) until the 1980s. A minor recovery of the subpopulation increased its range as far north as San Francisco (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). A recent trawl survey (2001) indicated that this species was largely concentrated offshore between San Francisco and the Point of Conception (33 and 38Â°N: Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). In April of 2011, total biomass of the subpopulation was estimated to be ~ 0.494 million metric tonnes (Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Independent surveys conducted by the U.S. and British Columbia have reported a significant decrease in sardine biomass (DFO 2011) and spawning stock biomass since 2006 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Spawning stock biomass has reached historically low levels in recent years (2014 - 2017: Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Total coast wide biomass in has declined by ~57% and ~ 79% between 2006 and 2010 in U.S. and Canadian waters, respectively (DFO 2011). The observed decrease in biomass coincided with unusual ocean conditions which may have affected overall abundance and distribution (DFO 2011), similar to other global subpopulations of this species. Recruitment in U.S. waters has also declined since 2005 - 2006 with the exception of a brief period of modest recruitment in 2009 - 2010; a small increase in recruitment was observed in 2016 but the estimate is highly variable and based off limited data (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). The 2001 - 2015 year classes have been among the weakest observed in recent history (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Exploitation rates of this species in U.S. waters have averaged about 11 % since 2005 with peak of 13% in 2013; both the U.S. and total exploitation rates of this species in northern U.S. were less than 1%&#160; in 2016 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><em>Southeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as<em> S. sagax sensu stricu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (southern Ecuador to central Peru), central (southern Peru to northern Chile), and southern (off Chile: Schartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999). In this region, this species is a dominant small pelagic resource along with the engraulid, <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(Passuni <em>et al. </em>2018) where it is known to undergo periods of high and low abundance, similar to other global subpopulations. Landings reported to the FAO (1950 - 2014) from the southeast Pacific are presumably referring to this subpopulation and are driven by landings from Peru and Chile with an average of 1.1 million tonnes (FAO 2016). The trend in reported landings tracks very closely with the global trends in landings of this species and is represented by a sharp increase between 1970 and the early 1980s followed by a peak in 1985 (~6.5 million tonnes) and a sharp decline until 2014, the most recent year available in the time series (936 tonnes: FAO 2016).<br/><br/><em>Northwestern Pacific </em>- This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is further subdivided into two units: one which occupies the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, and another which occurs along the Pacific coast (Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In this region, this species is important to fisheries and has experienced wide fluctuations similar to other global subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Declines in landings were reported in the 1940s and the fishery was greatly reduced in the northern portion of its range (e.g., Honshu and Hokkaido) and was primarily restricted to the western Sea of Japan and East China Sea (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The contraction of spawning grounds was also observed during this time (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The subpopulation reportedly recovered in the 1970's and expanded its spawning habitat to encompass grounds around southern Kyushu (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989), specifically including Tanegashima Island, Osumi Islands (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018). The population in the NW Pacific has shown a continuous decline from about 1987 - 2003 (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Biomass decreased from ~14 - 19 million tons in the 1980s to less than 1 million tons in the late 1990s; biomass remains at very low levels in the most recent years available (2005: Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, egg abundance has declined by at least an order of magnitude from the 1980s to the early 2000s; juvenile abundance has also declined since the mid-1990s (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/><em>Southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) is further subdivided into at least four units with some degree of overlap: southwestern coast (off Western Australia), Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf, Bass Strait and Port Phillip Bay (off Victoria and Tasmania), and eastern Australia; additional evidence exists for the subdivision of units off Western Australia and the east coast (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species is important to fisheries off Australian and New Zealand waters. Catches have increased since the beginning of the available time series (1975) with some fluctuation (Ward <em>et al. </em>2014a, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches peaked off Western Australia in the 1990s (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) but have remained at low levels over the last two decades following two mass mortality events which impacted the entire population in the mid - late 1990's (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whittington <em>et al.</em> 2008). A recent stock assessment off South Australia was conducted and indicated that catch and effort has increased between the years 1990 â 2016 after the establishment of a large fishery in 1991 (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017); it is possible that the increase in catch is also associated with high abundance years in this region. For example, the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) has increased over the last decade from 30,000 t in 2007 - 2009, to 42,750 t in 2017; total annual catches in South Australian waters have also increased (~30,000 t in 2007 to ~38,000 t in 2016: Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Significant catches in Australia have been taken from New South Wales, Victoria and in Commonwealth waters (Ward&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b), though a large majority of catch in this region is taken from South Australia (specifically Spencer Gulf), which represents only a small portion of this species total range (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017); there is concern regarding the potential local depletion in the Spencer Gulf (Izzo <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The fishery in South Australia (Spencer Gulf) was established in 1991 and is currently the largest fishery by volume in the country (Total Allowable Catch in 2016 was 38,000 t: Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Effort has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging from ~760 to 1100 net-sets per year (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual CPUE have risen from ~30 t/set-net in 2007 to over 40 t/set-net in 2015 and 2016 (Ward<em> et al.</em> 2017). The estimated spawning stock biomass for 2017 was estimated to be between 236,00 t - 305,000 t and is the largest obtained for the southern stock of sardine in Australian waters; the southern stock is classified as sustainable as the spawning biomass for 2017 exceeds the target reference point of 150,000 t in the harvest strategy for the South Australian Sardine Fishery (SASF: Ward <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/><em>Southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus</em> or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is further subdivided into at least two units: northern (Namibia) and southern (South Africa); additionally, the southern unit is broken down further into three subunits: east of Agulhas Bank, west of Agulhas Bank, and off KwaZulu-Natal (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2006, Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Okomadu 2017). Limited information is available related to this subpopulation, though it is commercially important and reported to follow similar boom-bust patterns of the other four global subpopulations. This species supports a major fishery in African waters and has largely experienced major fluctuations in catches (Okumadu 2017). Off Namibia, the biomass of this unit crashed in the late 1960's; a slight recovery was observed in the 1990's but various stresses (e.g., heavy fishing pressure and abnormal environmental conditions such as hypoxia and the Benguela El NiÃ±o) caused a further decline in biomass and catches (Okumadu 2017). Presently, low sardine biomass can only allow limited fishing activity (Okumadu 2017). Within South Africa, the small pelagic fishery which targets this unit is the largest commercial fishery by volume and the second largest in net value (Okumadu 2017). The South African Sardine purse seine fishery has been concentrated along the western coast since the 1940's (Okumadu 2017). This species has undergone wide fluctuations in abundance since the beginning of industrial-scale fishing (Okumadu 2017). Similar to Namibia, high sardine catches taken in South Africa in the early 1960s were followed by drastic declines (Okumadu 2017); a slow recovery followed after management measures were put in place in the mid - 1980s (Okumadu 2017). A slight increase in biomass and catches between 2001 and 2005 (~ 4 million tonnes) resulted from good recruitment; however poor recruitment in 2004 has led to another substantial decrease in biomass in recent years (~ 250,000 tonnes in 2007 - 2008: Okumadu 2017) and has remained at a low biomass since about 2006 (DAFF 2016). In 2015, the Total Allowable Catch for this species was set below 90,000 t for the first time since 1997 which represents its depleted state in South African waters (DAFF 2016). <br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span style=""""><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Unknown,"<em>Sardinops sagax </em>exhibits an antitropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations that were given taxonomic names at some time in their history. Based on Whitehead (1985) and Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), the distributions of these five subpopulations are as follows. In the eastern Pacific, this species occurs from southeastern Alaska, south to Baja California, including the Gulf of California (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>), and from Peru to Chile including the Galapagos Islands (referred to as&#160;<em>S. sagax sensu strictu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>). In the northwestern Pacific, it occurs from Peter the Great Bay, Russia, south to at least Taiwan; H. Hata (<em>pers. comm.</em> 2018) reports it to be widely distributed throughout Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu, but does not occur off the Ryukyu Islands (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>). In the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific, this species occurs from Shark Bay, Western Australia to the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland and New Zealand (referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>). In the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian, this species occurs from Baia dos Tigres, Angola to Durban, South Africa&#160; (referred to as&#160;<em>S. ocellatus</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>); more recent records report this species from Madagascar (Fricke <em>et al.</em> 2018) and the Macarenes (Fricke 1999).&#160;This species occurs in coastal waters to a depth of about 200 m<span style=""""> (Munroe 2016)<span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>","<p>In general, this species is one of the most important commercial fishes throughout a large portion of its range. It is caught with purse seine, trawls, gill nets and beach seines. Pilchards are marketed fresh, frozen or canned and used for fish meal and fish oil (Munroe 2016). Historically, the five subpopulations contributed about one-quarter of all clupeoid fishes caught making this the most productive out of all clupeoid genera (more than 8 million tonnes in 1983: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>    <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is fished by Canada, the United States and Mexic<span style="""">o (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Landings declined and a fishing moratorium was put in place in the late 1960s (Whitehead 1985) which was reopened in the 1980s. More recently, catches decreased by approximately 95% (1.8 million mt â 86,000 mt) off the U.S. coast between the years 2006 â 2017 warranting current fishery closures in this region (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).</span> </p>  <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) undergoes large southward geographical range shifts during El NiÃ±o years; Ecuadorian and Peruvian fisheries can experience drastic declines as this species migrates out of available fishing zones (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). It is not uncommon for total catch to exceed 1 â 2 million tons annually (Whitehead 1985). A majority of catch (~90%) is utilized for fishmeal for fish oil, ~ 4% is canned and the remaining quantity is marketed fresh or frozen (Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is one of the most commercially important fishes in Japan with record catches exceeding 4 million tons (Whitehead 1985). Observed catches declined sharply in the 1940s; however catches in this geographical region, as in others, generally show notable fluctuations (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>  <p>Compared to other subpopulations, no globally significant fishery has existed for the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) off Australia and New Zealand (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). However, based on a recent stock assessment off southern Australia, catch and effort for this species has increased between the years 1990 â 2016 (Ward <em>et al. </em>2017) to be regionally important. It is commonly used as fishing bait and fodder for aquaculture, and is taken with purse seine nets (Whitehead 1985, D.

Gaughan <em>pers. obs. </em>2001).</p>",Marine,"No known species-specific conservation measures are currently in place globally, though its total distribution overlaps with existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). Regional fishery management initiatives (i.e., yearly monitoring, stock assessments, quotas, limited entry fisheries and seasonal closures) are in place and implemented to a varying degree (Barange <em>et al. </em>2009) throughout most of it range, especially in Australia (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the United States (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018). Off California, fishing moratoriums have been put in place for this species during the 1960s - 1980s (Whitehead 1985), and more recently in 2015 - 2017 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018).","",,false,false,Global
145357488,18596,Pseudorca crassidens,Near Threatened,A2d,2018,2018-07-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>False Killer Whales are widely distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, but they are not common anywhere. They occur at highest densities in tropical areas, but even there are generally among the less common delphinids. The sum of existing abundance estimates is 59,157 animals, although the two largest estimates (accounting for approximately 94% of the total number) are more than 25 years old. No abundance estimates are available for a substantial part of the range of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely much higher than 60,000. Because of these whalesâ low density, abundance estimates are imprecise, and thus there is no ability to assess trends in most areas.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales feed on fish species that are targeted by major high-value fisheries, including tunas and billfishes, and they regularly engage in depredation on both catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. This makes them both more vulnerable to bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries and to reductions in available prey than most species of cetaceans with similar distributions, as these other species tend to feed on small mesopelagic fish and squid or on deep-water prey such as squid.<br/><br/>The primary threats to False Killer Whales are incidental mortality (âbycatchâ) in fisheries and, in some areas, directed hunting or culling. Generation length has been estimated at 25 years. Because of their life history, even low levels of bycatch or directed takes could result in population declines. Numbers taken in directed hunts in Japan have likely been great enough to reduce nearshore populations, and False Killer Whales are at least occasionally targeted in direct hunts in a few other parts of their range (Indonesia and West Indies). Bycatch is greatest in longline and other hook-and-line fisheries, but some mortality also occurs in gillnet and seine fisheries. In Hawaii, one area where they have been studied extensively, there is strong evidence of multiple subpopulations, and these have been recognized under U.S. law as separate stocks. Bycatch of the Hawaii pelagic stock in the U.S. longline fishery has been at a level thought to be high enough to limit population growth for most years since bycatch rates and abundance estimates have been available. This is a transboundary stock and foreign fleets account for the majority of longline effort in surrounding international waters, thus total bycatch levels are likely much higher than indicated by the U.S. observer program. Bycatch is known to occur in other areas but limited or no observer coverage in most fisheries and lack of abundance estimates precludes quantitative assessment of bycatch levels in relation to abundance. The only stock that has been quantitatively assessed (the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock) was estimated to have had a &gt;50% decline in abundance in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), with fishery interactions (primarily hooking and entanglement) thought to be the most important threat.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List in 2008, and the species remains data-poor for most of its range. The Red List Guidelines (Version 13, 2017) note that a taxon that comes close to qualifying for the Vulnerable (VU) category based on the Vulnerable thresholds qualifies for the Near Threatened (NT) category. This consideration combined with biological susceptibility and threat strengthens the case for a NT listing. A 30% or greater decline in three generations based on category A2(d) â a population reduction observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation â qualifies a taxon for the Vulnerable category. The False Killer Whale comes close to meeting the criteria for VU for the following reasons: 1) there has been an estimated population decline of &gt;50% in two generations in the one population that has been quantitatively assessed, with the primary cause thought to be fishery interactions; 2) bycatch is a widespread threat at levels suspected to be large enough to result in population reduction throughout much of the taxonâs range, and levels of fishing effort are unlikely to decline substantially in the near future; 3) levels of directed take in some areas are likely high enough to have reduced local populations; and 4) biological susceptibility to population-level effects of bycatch exists given the life history of these whales, the overlap of their diet with the target species of high-value commercial fisheries, and their tendency to engage in depredation on catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. Given the above, False Killer Whales are therefore assessed as NT. Although the rangewide decline could be large enough for the species to qualify for VU, collecting the data necessary to quantify the extent of decline for a globally distributed, pelagic species is very difficult. Risk levels could be better assessed at the subpopulation level and efforts should be made toward that end.</p>","<p>While False Killer Whales occur in tropical, sub-tropical, and at least occasionally in warm temperate waters worldwide (Stacey <em>et al</em>. 1994, Odell and McClune 1999), their density is highest in the tropics (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). They are generally found in relatively deep, offshore waters, but individuals do approach close to shore around oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii). Individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands resident subpopulation use both shallow (&lt;100 m) and deep (to 4,700 m) waters around the Hawaiian archipelago (Baird 2016). Some animals may move into shallow and higher latitude waters seasonally (e.g., off New Zealand; Zaeschmar 2014) or periodically (including some semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean). Individuals have been documented spending extended periods of time (two to three months) in shallow water areas of the Timor and Arafura seas (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2017). Individuals and groups have been reported to enter rivers on the Chinese mainland (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995), but it was not clear whether these occurrences might have represented pre-stranding behaviour.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales eat primarily relatively large fish and cephalopods (Alonso <em>et al</em>. 1999). They have been known to attack and consume small dolphins that have been injured or disoriented when released from tuna purse seine nets, but this behavior may be more akin to learning to take advantage of opportunistic food sources than to a predilection to feed on other species of marine mammals (Baird 2018). They eat some large species of fish, such as Mahimahi (also called Dorado or Dolphinfish), Yellowfin Tuna, Skipjack Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Opah, Wahoo, pomphrets, Broadbill Swordfish and Sailfish (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Hawaiian waters observational studies suggest that large pelagic game fish (Mahimahi, tunas, billfishes) form the majority of their diet (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016). Depredation data on longline-caught fish suggest a preference for billfishes, Wahoo and tunas over Mahimahi, pomfrets, Walu, sharks or lancetfishes (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>False Killer Whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, upper-trophic level predators, and as such are subject to effects of a number of different anthropogenic stressors. The overlap of their diet with species targeted by fisheries, in particular high-value species such as tunas and billfishes, results in a number of types of interactions that can reduce local populations, although the sparseness of observer coverage in most hook-and-line and other fisheries within the range of False Killer Whales limits the information available. In addition, the False Killer Whale is one of several species known to mass strand (Caldwell <em>et al. </em>1970, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liebig <em>et al.</em> 2007), with the largest known mass stranding of 835 individuals in Argentina in 1946 (Caillet-Bois 1948). Such mass strandings have the potential to affect local populations.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales are hooked in longline fisheries as they engage in depredation on both the catch and bait (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Thode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The U.S. Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery has had approximately 20% observer coverage since 2001, and has provided detailed information on bycatch rates. In this fishery, False Killer Whales are the most frequently recorded species of cetacean hooked as bycatch (Forney and Kobayashi 2005, Bradford and Forney 2014). The first abundance estimates became available for the Hawaii pelagic stock in 2003 (Barlow 2006, Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b), and documented mortality and serious injury inside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR) level for 10 of the 12 years from 2003-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;2017). Rates of hooking or entanglement are approximately 1.5 individuals for every 1 million hooks set. This is a transboundary population and non-U.S. fisheries outside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago represent the majority of longline effort, thus bycatch rates for the entire Hawaii pelagic stock are likely much higher than estimated. Non-lethal but potentially significant injuries (such as those that compromise health and ability to reproduce) may also occur if animals are hooked (Baird and Gorgone 2005, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014, Alves <em>et al</em>. 2018). The rate of non-lethal line-related injuries is significantly higher in the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock than in the Hawaii pelagic stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014). The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock has only limited overlap with the longline fishery, but there are no observers in the nearshore fisheries, and thus no bycatch estimates are available. Longline fisheries occur throughout the central and western tropical Pacific, and similar interactions with False Killer Whales occur in other regions (e.g., Indian Ocean, Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010, Anderson 2014; American Samoa, Bradford and Forney 2014; Mediterranean, Bearzi 2002; western North Atlantic, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). Observers on Spanish longline vessels documented two bycaught False Killer Whales off the Azores in 2006 in approximately 810,000 observed hooks (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008), a rate similar to the Hawaii-based longline fishery. The incidental catch rate (including animals hooked but released alive) was estimated from 1992-2005 from observers in the Spanish longline fleet at 1.464, 1.685, and 0.797 individuals per million hooks for the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, respectively (Ramos-Cartelle and Mejuto 2008.) Observer programs to monitor bycatch in fisheries in most parts of the world are limited (if they exist at all), but given what is known regarding both the abundance of False Killer Whales and their predilection to take fish off lines, there is certainly potential for bycatch to result in population declines.</p>  <p>Based on observer reports, False Killer Whales were the most frequently reported species of cetacean killed in the tropical western and central Pacific purse seine fishery in 2009, with an estimated mortality of 281 (SPC-OFP 2010). Interactions with this fishery were observed within the EEZs of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru, and in international waters. Mortality of False Killer Whales has been documented in Chinese purse seine fisheries in the western Pacific (Dai <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, the only mortality documented in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery since 2001 was in 2010 (IATTC 2011).<br/><br/>Incidental takes of small numbers of False Killer Whales in gill nets have been documented off northern Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan, Republic of Korea, and China (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2014, Song 2018). Wang <em>et al</em>. (2013) noted that entanglement in large-mesh drift gillnets is likely responsible for most False Killer Whale fishery-related mortality off eastern Taiwan. Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported on cetacean bycatch rates in Chinese coastal fisheries (trawl, gill, and stow nets), which may number in the hundreds per year for False Killer Whales alone.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales have been taken in drive and harpoon fisheries in a number of areas, either for meat or oil, or to reduce populations due to real or perceived fishery conflicts. At least in some areas, the numbers taken have likely reduced local populations. False Killer Whales are occasionally taken at Saint Vincent in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Considerable numbers of False Killer Whales have also been killed in a past drive fishery in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995). Official catch records were not recorded until 1972, but from 1958 to 1960, 900 individuals were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu (Kasuya 2017). From 1972 to 2008, 2,643 were reported killed in all fishery types (including bycatch) in Japan, with the highest number in one year of 637 in 1978 (Kasuya 2017). Abundance for coastal Japan was estimated at 2,029 (Kasuya 2017), so this one-year take would have represented approximately 31% of the coastal population as estimated from 1983 to 1991. Over 1,500 were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu between 1972 and 1993, with peak mortality occurring from 1978 to 1983 when 1,358 were reportedly taken (Kasuya 2017). Smaller numbers (171) were killed in a drive fishery at Izu on the east coast of Honshu from 1978 to 1996 with 123 taken in 1978 (Kasuya 2017), and 79 were killed in a crossbow fishery in Okinawa between 1993 and 2011 (Kasuya 2017). False Killer Whales have also been killed in the drive fishery at Taiji on the west coast of Honshu, with 586 killed between 1982 and 2011 and up to 91 killed in a single year (Kasuya 2017). Quotas are in place in Japan for drive and crossbow fisheries although those quotas have only rarely been reached in recent years (Kasuya 2017). Some of the animals caught in the Japanese and Taiwanese drive fisheries have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Deliberate shooting in response to depredation may also occur in a number of areas. Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted, for example, that in Hawaii fishermen have reported shooting at False Killer Whales or other dolphins in response to depredation. Anderson (2014) noted that False Killer Whales are likely being shot by tuna longline fishermen in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable controversy regarding the absolute extent of declines, there is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Polacheck 2006), including Yellowfin and Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2009; Langley <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition to overfishing, expansion in the extent of unproductive areas and other ecosystem changes (e.g., Polovina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Coll <em>et al</em>. 2008, Koslow <em>et al.</em> 2015) have the potential to influence fish populations at multiple trophic levels. The effects of such reductions of fish populations and subsequent ecosystem changes on populations of False Killer Whales worldwide are unknown but could have resulted in population declines.<br/><br/>Studies of persistent organic pollutants in the main Hawaiian Islands insular population have revealed that all adult males and a number of adult females sampled from the population have levels of PCBs that exceed thresholds thought to cause immunosuppression (Ylitalo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Foltz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); False Killer Whales may also be at risk from this threat.</p><p></p>","<p>Density of False Killer Whales is highest in low latitudes; in the eastern North Pacific, for example, density drops by an order of magnitude north of approximately 15Â°N (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). Abundance estimates are available for a number of areas, and in general False Killer Whales are among the least abundant delphinids even in their highest density areas (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Ballance and Pitman 1998). In the eastern tropical Pacific, in an area of 19.1 million kmÂ², False Killer Whale abundance was estimated as 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.64) based on line-transect surveys from 1986-1991 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). In the western North Pacific, in an area of 2.9 million kmÂ², abundance was estimated as 16,668 (CV 0.26) based on line-transect surveys from 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Kasuya (2017) subdivided this estimate based on region, and noted for coastal Japan (30Â°-42Â°N and west of 145Â°E) the abundance was estimated as 2,029 (95% confidence interval (CI) 907-4,541). In the Gulf of Mexico, there are three False Killer Whale abundance estimates based on line-transect surveys: 381 (CV 0.62) for 1991-1994, 1,038 (CV 0.71) for 1996-2001, and 777 (CV 0.56) for 2003-2004 (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). For U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic, abundance was estimated as 442 (CV 1.06) based on a survey in 2011 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the western Indian Ocean, the False Killer Whale ranked 11th out of 13 species of delphinids in relative abundance (Ballance and Pitman 1998), based on a line-transect survey in 1995. Abundance off New Zealand was estimated as 111 individuals based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data collected during 2005-2012 (Zaeschmar 2014).<br/><br/>The only region where abundance estimates have been apportioned by stock is within the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago. The abundance estimate for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified animals was 167 individuals (standard error 23) in 2015 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). This is the only population where trend information is available, and several lines of evidence suggest that abundance in the 1980s was much higher, likely in the 400-700 range (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2009, Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), which would indicate a substantial long-term decline. More recent trend (i.e., 2000s through 2015) is unknown due to the variability associated with recent abundance estimates (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Abundance of the insular stock in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, in an area of 0.4 million kmÂ², was estimated as 552 individuals (CV 1.09) based on a line-transect survey in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The abundance of the pelagic stock within the entire U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago (an area of 2.3 million kmÂ²) was estimated as 1,540 individuals (CV 0.66) based on a 2010 line-transect survey although vessel attraction was not accounted for and this therefore may have led to overestimation of abundance (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Although no abundance estimate was given, Anderson (2014) noted that the numbers of False Killer Whales around the Maldives had decreased over a 20-year period and that it may have been due to interactions with longline fisheries in the area.<br/><br/>The generation length for False Killer Whales was estimated at 25 years by Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010), thus three generations is 75 years. The only subpopulation with sufficient evidence to assess trends over more than one generation is the main Hawaiian Island insular population, where there is evidence of a greater than 50% decline in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"False Killer Whales are found in tropical to warm temperate zones, generally in relatively deep, offshore waters in all three major oceans. Densities are much higher in tropical regions and movements into higher latitudes may be associated with warmer currents, or they could be seasonal (Zaeschmar 2014). False Killer Whales do not generally range into latitudes higher than 50Â° in either hemisphere. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas and bays, including the Sea of Japan, Bohai/Yellow Sea, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, but they are observed only occasionally in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017, Baldwin <em>et al</em> 1999, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1989). There are a few records for the Baltic Sea, which are considered extralimital (Aguayo 1978).","<p>False Killer Whales are taken in hand-harpoon and drive hunts as well as small-type whaling (with a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size limit) in Japan (Kishiro and Kasuya 1993, Kasuya 2017). They are also hunted at least opportunistically in Indonesia (Barnes 1991) and the West Indies (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Quotas remain for takes of False Killer Whale in drive fisheries and hand-harpoon fisheries in Japan (Kasuya 2017). Although there is no legal hunting of False Killer Whales in the Republic of Korea, meat from False Killer Whales has been represented in markets at significantly higher rates than expected based on reports of bycaught animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006). Based on their analysis, Baker <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggested that the False Killer Whales must be killed at a rate 10-times greater than the reported bycatch.<br/><br/>Some of the animals caught in the drive hunt or bycaught in Japan have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984) and a few were live-captured in California and Hawaii as recently as the 1970s (Reeves and Leatherwood 1984).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p>The False Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<br/><br/>The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (subpopulation) was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2012. A number of âbiologically important areasâ have been recognized for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2015). Critical habitat for this stock was designated in 2018 as part of a settlement from a lawsuit. Both the Hawaiian pelagic stock and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock are subjects of a False Killer Whale Take Reduction Plan as required by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act that went into effect in 2013, in an attempt to reduce bycatch in the Hawaii-based longline fisheries to a level below its calculated potential biological removal. The Take Reduction Plan includes both gear changes (mandating âweakâ circle hooks with a maximum wire diameter of 4.5 mm and âstrongâ branchlines, with a minimum diameter of 2.0 mm) as well as handling guidelines to try to allow hooks to straighten, releasing animals from the gear. In addition, prior to the Take Reduction Plan the longline exclusion area around the main Hawaiian Islands would seasonally contract towards the islands for four months of the year, but the Take Reduction Plan removed that seasonal shift, thus reducing overlap between the longline fishery and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock. Overall however, as of April 2018, serious injury and mortality rates in the Hawaii-based longline fishery (with the vast majority from the Hawaii pelagic stock of False Killer Whales) had not declined.</p><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In areas with plenty of deadwood, the species can fruit very numerously and is then sometimes among the most common spring fungi. This applies in particular to near-natural montane beech-fir spruce forests like the natural forest Lahnsattel (Lower Austria) or outside of Austria to different areas of the Bohemian Forest. For this reason, <em>P.&#160;</em><em>melaena&#160;</em>is sometimes regarded as an indicator species for semi-natural habitats especially for semi-natural forests with large old trees (200+ years old) displaying ecological continuity, which was recently confirmed in the comparison of several near-natural spruce-fir-beech forests.&#160;<br/><br/>At suitable locations it can be found for years, e.g. in the natural forest Lahnsattel (St. Aegyd am Neuwalde) where the species was first observed in 1992, and the latest evidence comes from 2017.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Pseudoplectania&#160;</em><em>melaena&#160;</em>prefers to grow on recumbent, heavily pruned, barked, and overgrown trunks and thicker branches of old trees. Since the dead wood acts as a water reservoir, the species can form fruit bodies even in unfavourable weather conditions.<br/><br/>Phenologically it fructifies mostly in spring from snowmelt; the preferred months in Austria are March to May with a clear growth peak in April. In total, finds are known in the period from December to May.","It is in several Red Lists of Central European countries in which it is classified as at least Endangered: Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Switzerland, Czechia. The population shows declining tendencies.<br/><br/>The habitat in North America is highly restricted and had undergone serious decline until protection in the last 20 years.<br/><br/>Habitat trends in Asia are currently insufficiently known.<br/><br/>The substrate required by <em>P.&#160;</em><em>melaena&#160;</em>- rotten fir dead wood - is present in most of the managed forests in insufficient quantities, therefore the species is missing in many places or is mainly found in semi-natural forests. Although the latter are often taken out of commercial use, the general decline of the white fir even in natural forests, e.g., in the primeval forest of BoubÃ­nskÃ½ Prales, where <em>P. melaena</em> is currently still quite common, poses a long-term threat.","Based on GBIF and databases available (see references) 172 subpopulations are known worldwide.

It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June, with males leaving the breeding areas first from May to early-June to undertake extensive moult migrations (females following later) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). During moult, large sexually segregated flocks gather in moulting areas (e.g. in the Netherlands and Russia), although small gatherings are also possible (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). The flightless moult period lasts for around 4 weeks between July and August, after which flocks move southwards to winter quarters from mid-August onwards (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is highly gregarious in winter and on passage, often forming enormous concentrations (although the size of flock depends on the size of the wetland) (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds nocturnally; flocks are roosting by day on open water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species shows a preference for open lowland grassland, prairie or tundra habitats containing freshwater, brackish and saline wetlands with shallow water (10-30 cm deep) to facilitate dabbling (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers, wet meadows, flood-plains and sewage ponds (southern Africa), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). During the winter, it also frequents large inland lakes, brackish coastal lagoons, brackish and saline marshes, shallow fresh or brackish estuaries, tidal flats and river deltas with adjacent agricultural land (e.g. stubble fields) and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>This species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of algae, seeds (e.g. cereals and rice), tubers (e.g. potatoes), and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants, sedges and grasses, as well as aquatic invertebrates (e.g. insects, molluscs and crustaceans), amphibians and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (e.g. rushes, grass or low scrub) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species is not normally colonial, but neighbours may nest as close as 2-3 m apart (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe, and major river diversion and irrigation schemes threaten wintering areas in Niger and Nigeria (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). Over-exploitation is a concern in Europe (Kear 2005). It also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994), poisoning from white phosphorous (from firearms) ingestion in Alaska (Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997), and reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain (Paveglio <em>et al.</em> 1997).

The species feeds on fish, crustacea and cephalopods, which are caught while diving. Short (1-3 days) and long (5-15 days) provisioning trips are made by parents; longer trips allow foraging along the Antarctic Polar Front, reducing competition close to breeding grounds and allowing vast colonies to persist&#160;(Weimerskirch 1998).<p></p><p></p>","<p>The species is at risk from incidental capture in longline, trawl and gill-net fisheries and suffers the additional effects of depletion of prey stocks (Uhlmann 2003). A large number of deaths occur as a result of interaction with fisheries both during the breeding season and the winter migration to the Northern Hemisphere (Uhlmann 2003). The species is also subject to direct persecution, and harvesting of young birds ('muttonbirding') currently accounts for the take of around a quarter of a million birds annually (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997, Newman <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2009), but is unlikely to account for the scale of the observed decline. </p>  <p>Past investigation into the biological impact of climatic trends led to predictions of large-scale shifts in foraging distribution during the boreal summer and/or dramatic reductions in abundance and survival rate (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996, 1997, Spear and Ainley 1999, Wahl and Tweit 2000, Oedekoven <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hyrenbach and Veit 2003). Climate change is already affecting the foraging distribution of this species along the Californian coast (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1997). Evidence shows that birds are still visiting many of the same foraging areas, but are taking new routes to avoid altered current systems (Veit <em>et al</em>. 2003).

In Australia, there are colonies on 17 islands, all of which contain fewer than 1,000 pairs. In southern Chile, some colonies number up to 200,000 pairs, with the largest colony of up to 4 million individuals on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Falklands (Malvinas), 10,000-20,000 pairs have been recorded. New Zealand supports more than 180 colonies.

In 1970-1971, the colonies on the Snares Islands were estimated to support 2,750,000 breeding pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997). Although this is an extremely numerous species, there are persistent signs of a current decline (Brooke 2004). In New Zealand, the number of burrows in the largest colony on the Snares Islands declined by 37% between 1969-1971 and 1996-2000, and burrow occupancy may also have declined, indicating that an overall population decline may have occurred (Warham and Wilson 1982, Scofield and Christie 2002, Scott <em>et al.</em> 2008). Some colonies on mainland New Zealand have declined, and several colonies on offshore islands, especially in northern New Zealand, have not responded to predator control (Gaze 2000, Jones 2000, Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, other colonies in southern New Zealand have responded to sustained pest management with increasing numbers (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The species migrates to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter (Shaffer<em> et al.</em> 2006, Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2012), and in the California Current, Sooty Shearwater numbers have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996).

Forest areas with multiple canopy layers and high moss abundance are strongly preferred. Research in British Columbia shows that in areas where forest habitat is relatively plentiful the species seldom re-use the same trees as nest sites, whereas in areas where logging has reduced old-growth there is a higher proportion of nest tree re-use (Burger <em>et al. </em>2009). The species has been shown to suffer increased predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas, compared with forest edges adjacent to regenerating or riparian areas (Malt and Lank 2007, 2009). Multiple radar and modelling studies have shown a significant correlation between numbers of birds entering watersheds and the areas of suitable forest habitat within those watersheds (Burger 2002, Burger <em>et al. </em>2004, Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2011). Breeding is mid-March to early September in California, but more compressed further north (Hamer and Nelson 1995a, 1995b, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002). The diet is sandlance, herring, other small schooling fish and, in winter, invertebrates (Gaston and Jones 1998, Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Chicks are generally fed large subadult or adult prey rather than juveniles or larvae (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006). It feeds in near-shore habitats up to 1.4 km offshore, in sheltered waters, lagoons and sometimes inland lakes (Carter 1986, Hunt 1995, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Hebert and Golightly 2008). The effect of marine attributes on murrelet productivity varies from increasing density and productivity estimates with increasing sea surface temperature in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington (1995-2007; Raphael and Bloxton 2008), to decreasing reproductive efforts with warmer sea-surface temperatures in California (Bigger and Chinnici 2008). Sea-surface temperatures and other marine attributes explained little of the variation in murrelet distribution and abundance compared to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2015). Daily movements to feeding areas can be up to 250 km in exceptional cases (Whitworth <em>et al. </em>2000), but are normally about 30 km (Burger 2002, Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Radio-marked birds from Redwood Creek in North California moved a maximum average distance of 99 km alongshore, with males travelling further than females, and non-breeding males travelling further than breeding males, perhaps in search of mates or nesting habitats. Average home range size was 505 km<sup>2</sup>, again being greater for males than females (Hebert and Golightly 2008). Individuals exhibit plasticity in their foraging behaviour, foraging closer to shore and increasing dive rates during nesting (Peery <em>et al</em>. 2009). Marbled Murrelets most often forage in pairs (Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006). Individuals in the northern part of its range may travel south during the non-breeding season, a movement which likely reflects the availability of prey (Piatt <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>","<p>Loss of nesting habitat is strongly linked to population decline through most of the speciesâ range (Burger 2002, Burger and Waterhouse 2009, Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006). The massive (85â90%) reduction in old-growth forest (nesting habitat) in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia due to logging likely drove the decline and fragmentation of Murrelet populations in these regions (Sealy and Carter 1984, Rodway <em>et al.</em> 1992, Stein and Miller 1992). Forest loss and fragmentation continues, with the area of 'higher-suitability' habitat declining by 12% between 1993 and 2012 (c.18% in three generations), most of which occurred on non-federal land (Falxa&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016). In accordance, Long <em>et al.</em> (2011) estimated that suitable Murrelet nesting habitat declined by 20-22% between 1978 and 2008 in British Columbia. Multiple radar studies have shown that when breeding habitat is reduced by logging, the birds do not show ability to relocate to remaining forest patches in higher densities, but instead suffer population declines (Burger 2001, Burger <em>et al. </em>2004, Raphael <em>et al. </em>2006), and there is strong support for habitat loss due to logging being the primary driving mechanism for speciesâ decline (Burger 2002). A linked threat is the elevated predation pressures at range margins. Murrelet distribution and abundance is directly correlated to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the species has been found to suffer increased corvid (jays and ravens) predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas (Burger 2002, Malt and Lank 2007, 2009). Other experiments found that the rate of predation of artificial nests on the Olympic Peninsula was significantly correlated with corvid abundance (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>In addition, the species is at risk from interaction with commercial fisheries, and changes in prey availability caused by the combined effects of overharvesting and climate change. In 1990, an estimated 1,468 seabirds were killed in fishing nets, 97% of which were Murrelets. In total, some 3300 (2940 adult) Murrelets may drown in fish nets annually throughout their range in Alaska. Assuming a population size of 280,000 individuals, of which 70% are adult breeders, then as much as 1.5% of adult mortality may derive from bycatch. And yet, this estimate does not include mortality in set nets, pound nets or seine nets (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Intense exploitation of prey species during the last century have contributed to depleting the Murreletâs preferred food resources, causing a shift to lower-trophic-level food items (i.e. krill, sandlance and rockfishes), which appears to have been partly responsible for poor Murrelet reproduction. The decrease in trophic level was most pronounced in pre-breeding diets, which plays a crucial role in alcid life history (Becker and Bessinger 2006). Since the collapse of the Pacific sardine populations, prey quality and abundance has declined, with lower trophic-level prey (e.g. krill) now dominating the pre-breeding diet in California (Becker and Bessinger 2006). This has resulted in a lower proportion of individuals reaching breeding condition, and therefore lower population productivity.</p><p>Climate change is likely exacerbating the reductions in food availability, through changes in sea water temperatures, composition of marine fish communities, and reduced overall fish biomass with dramatic consequences in the diet and population ecology of higher vertebrates that depend on those fish populations (Piatt and Anderson, in press). Unlike short-term phenomena such as El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the predicted long-term shifts due to climate change represent a more pervasive and persistent change in the ecosystem and can potentially have long-term effects on Alaskan Murrelet populations (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Miller <em>et al.</em> (2012) attributed the 2000-2010 population decline to changes in the marine environment causing reduced availability or quality of prey (among other factors), and juvenile recruitment off Vancouver Island was significantly reduced in a year of low marine productivity and prey availability (Ronconi and Burger 2008).</p><p>Mortality due to oil pollution represents another major threat to Marbled Murrelet populations. Past spills (e.g. Apex Houston, Exxon Valdez, Nestucca and New Carissa) have cause considerable mortality in affected colonies (Piatt and Naslund 1995, Nelson 1997, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Titmus and Smith 2008). The 1989 Exxon Valdez event killed an estimated 8,400 Marbled Murrelets (c.3% of the Alaskan population) and the toll from chronic pollution is unknown (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Future oil spills will continue to threaten the viability of small, declining populations, especially in California, Oregon and Washington where a single large spill could potentially extirpate an entire population (Carter and Kuletz 1995).</p><p>        </p><p>Owing to their coastal distribution and use of relatively sheltered marine habitats, Murrelets are more exposed to vessel activities than most other seabirds in the region. Human disturbance can disrupt foraging birds and persistent boat traffic may displace birds from important foraging areas. Carter and Kuletz (1994) found that Murrelet numbers were negatively correlated with numbers of boats and low-flying aircrafts, and presented suggestive evidence that human disturbance and traffic caused disruptions to breeding.</p><p></p>","<p>COSEWIC (2012) estimated the total population to number 358,200-417,500 individuals, rounded here to 350,000-420,000 individuals, based on 271,000 individuals in Alaska (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2007), 72,600-125,600 in British Columbia (Bertram <em>et al.</em> 2007), and 15,400-23,900 individuals in Washington, Oregon and California (Falxa <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Brachyramphus marmoratus</em> occurs in the <strong>USA</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, south-east Alaska, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Lower Cook Inlet, Barren Islands, Afognak and Kodiak Islands, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutians locally to Andreanof and Near Islands (Gaston and Jones 1998). In Alaska (70% of the population), historical estimates place the population at c. 750,000 individuals, though when trend estimates are applied to this figure it gives an estimated 2006 population of c. 271,000 individuals (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2007). The British Columbia population was previously thought to be c. 54,000 - 92,500 (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006) but extrapolations from recent radar counts suggest the population may in fact be c. 72,600-125,600 birds (COSEWIC 2012). This higher estimate is likely due to differences in survey methodology as opposed to a genuine population increase. The population in Washington, Oregon and California is estimated at 15,400-23,900 individuals (Falxa <em>et al.</em> 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016).&#160;The greatest historical decreases have occurred in Washington, Oregon and California, and these continue (A.

Detailed conservation recommendations were made in 1990s (USFWS 1992, Ralph <em>et al.</em> 1995). Federal land-use in the USA is regulated, areas for management identified and surveyed, and some temporarily removed from logging (Nelson 1997, Raphael 2006). In August 2016, the USFWS released the final determination on critical habitat for the species in the listed range and in January 2010 determined that the species still warrented protection and listing as Threatened after numerous challenges by the timber industry. USFWS initiated a status review of the species in 2008, which will also function as a 5-year status review (Harrison 2008). In Canada there has been extensive research, an updated recovery strategy (Environment Canada 2014), some (relatively minor) habitat protection under the British Columbia Forest and Range Practices Act, more extensive protection of forest habitat under various Land Use agreements and a radar monitoring plan developed by the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team (CMMRT 2003, COSEWIC 2012). The Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team developed a Recovery Strategy to be compliant with the Canadian Species at Risk Act (Environment Canada 2014). This lays out the general strategy for population stability (population reduction between 2002 and 2032 not to exceed 30% of the 2002 population and this decline is linked to similar limited decline in available suitable nesting habitat). The essential Marine and Terrestrial Action Plans required by the Species at Risk Act have not been drafted (as of 2016) and these are not likely to be completed and implemented before 2020. Under the Canadian Recovery Strategy critical nesting habitat requiring protection is defined as 70% of the 2002 suitable nesting habitat coast-wide, with varying percentages (68-90%) in the six conservation regions in British Columbia (Environment Canada 2014).</p>  <p>The U.S. Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) began developing a Marbled Murrelet Long-Term Conservation Strategy in 2007 (Escene 2007); the final strategy still has not been released as of 2016. The Northwest Forest Plan (1994) is expected to ensure the protection of a large proportion of important habitats in the USA (Raphael 2006).</p>  <p>Extensive areas of suitable forest nesting habitat have been set aside in conservancies on the northern and central mainland and in Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) (COSEWIC 2012). Smaller areas are being protected by other forestry and conservation measures. Overall, an estimated 35% of the 1,826,828 hectares of&#160; suitable habitat in all of British Columbia (based on the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team modeling criteria [CMMRT 2003]) had been protected under various measures by 2011 (COSEWIC 2012). In 1998, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council protected 179 km<sup>2</sup> of Afognak Island (<em>BBC Wildlife</em> 1999 172: 23). In 2007, 1,569 ha of forested land on the Oregon Coast was acquired under conservation easement for the species (amongst others), part funded by the New Carissa oil-spill funds (Escene 2007). Between 1998 and 2002, 507 Marbled Murrelets were radio-tracked in British Columbia (<span lang=""EN-US"">Zharikov <em>et al. </em>2007) and during 2005-2007, 111 birds were radio-tracked at Port Snettisham, Alaska, to determine nesting habitat, activity patterns and distribution (Nelson <em>et al. </em>2008). A recommended protocol for surveying the species in forests was published in 2003 by PSG (Mack <em>et al. </em>2003). In British Columbia standard protocols have been developed for various survey methods (RISC 2001, Manley 2006). Research has shown that habitat management at relatively fine scales may provide conservation benefits (Horton 2008) and that the species would benefit from a reduction in the amount of hard edges (recent clear-cuts) at both patch and landscape scales (Malt and Lank 2007, 2009).<br/> <br/> <strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/> Survey potential nesting habitat on all ownerships and protect all occupied sites. Collect data on the ratio of juvenile to adult birds from sites throughout the range, and monitor over time, as this is thought to be a reliable indicator of productivity (Peery <em>et al.</em> 2007). Research means of improving the abundance of high quality food, e.g. small fish, during the pre-breeding period. Minimise damage to fish stocks and feeding areas (RENEW Report 1999 9: 20). Conduct research on the behaviour of migrants to determine the extent to which dispersal results in gene flow and prevents declines in resident populations (Peery <em>et al.</em> 2010). Complete and implement the SARA-compliant Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Action Plans needed to implement the Canadian Recovery Strategy (Environment Canada 2014). Protect nesting habitat throughout the species range, create larger blocks of habitat, provide buffers and other means for minimizing edge effects and predation (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999, USFWS 2012). Renew the radar monitoring at British Columbia watersheds (Bertram <em>et al.</em> 2015), in order to track population trends and determine the effects of habitat removal (logging) and local changes in marine conditions. Move campgrounds away from old-growth areas in Californian State Parks, in order to reduce predator populations in breeding areas. Reduce oil-spills, gill-net mortality and logging (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999). List as Threatened in Alaska (K. J. Kuletz <em>in litt.</em> 1999).</p><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The species breeds from May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Once females have started incubating (Kear 2005b) (from June or early-July) (Scott and Rose 1996) males congregate (Kear 2005b) and undertake extensive moult migrations or remain near the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988) to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996) (the females moult on the breeding grounds) (Madge and Burn 1988). After the post-breeding moult migratory populations of the species migrate south, the peak of the autumn migration occurring between October and November (Scott and Rose 1996). It returns to the breeding areas from late-February onwards (peaking March-April) (Scott and Rose 1996). Outside of the breeding season the species forms large concentrations, with large flocks of 30-40 and sometimes hundreds of individuals gathering at winter roosting sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988). The species forages at night during the winter (especially during the hunting season) but forages by day during the breeding season (Kear 2005b). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species shows a preference for shallow (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) permanent waters (Johnsgard 1978) in the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), especially those in the vicinity of woodlands with fairly dense herbaceous cover available nearby for nesting (Johnsgard 1978). Small freshwater lakes and shallow marshes with abundant emergent vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) are preferred to open water (Johnsgard 1978), as are small waterbodies forming part of a larger wetland, lake or river system, especially in the valleys of small forested rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). Other suitable habitats include small ponds, pools (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), oxbow lakes, lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998) and slow-flowing streams (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species frequents similar habitats to those in which it breeds (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), including marsh and lake habitats and other sheltered waters with high productivity and abundant vegetation (Kear 2005b) as well as flooded fields and artificial waters (e.g. reservoirs) (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species also occurs along the coast (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) on saline (Snow and Perrins 1998) or brackish lagoons with abundant submergent vegetation (Kear 2005b), saltmarshes (Madge and Burn 1988), tidal creeks (Johnsgard 1978), intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005b), river deltas (Madge and Burn 1988), estuarine waters (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) and even sheltered coastal bays (Madge and Burn 1988), although it does show a preference for marshes with mud flats for foraging rather than more saline or open-water habitats (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Diet </strong><em>Breeding</em> In spring and summer the diet of the species consists predominantly of animal matter such as molluscs, worms, insects and crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> During winter the species mainly takes the seeds of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. emergent and submerged macrophytes) (Kear 2005b), grasses, sedges and agricultural grain (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (cereals and rice) (Kear 2005b). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a hollow in the ground placed amongst dense vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or under bushes close to water (rarely more then 100 m away) (Kear 2005b). Neighbouring pairs may sometimes nest only 1 m apart although the species is not colonial (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information </strong>A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg ha<sup>1</sup>, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). Studies in Danish coastal wetlands found that the spatial restriction of shore-based shooting was more successful at maintaining waterfowl population sizes than was the temporal restriction of shooting, and therefore that wildfowl reserves should incorporate shooting-free refuges that include adjacent marshland in order to ensure high waterfowl species diversity (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2004).","This species is threatened by lowland habitat loss and degradation (e.g. through wetland drainage) (Musil 2006) and by upland habitat loss due to afforestation and other land-use changes (Kear 2005b). The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (France) (Mondain-Monval<em> et al.</em> 2002) and from poisoning by white phosphorous ingestion (from firearms) in Alaska (Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997). It is also intensively hunted in its winter quarters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is threatened by disturbance from human recreational activities (Pease <em>et al.</em> 2005), hunting (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2004) and construction work (UK) (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet <em>et al. </em>2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted for sport in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994, Padding <em>et al.</em> 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006), France (Mondain-Monval <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Italy (Sorrenti <em>et al.</em> 2006), and is hunted commercially and recreationally in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). The eggs of this species were (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).","The overall population is estimated at 6,600,000-7,700,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

However, modelling of the likely effects of mortality caused by longline fishing fleets, combined with potential losses to breeding colonies from sea-level rise and storm surges, suggests it is appropriate to precautionarily predict a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations (56 years), hence it is classified as Near Threatened rather than Least Concern.<br/><br/><p></p> <p></p>","<p>It breeds on beaches and slopes with little or no vegetation, and on short turf. The species feeds mainly on flying fish eggs, squid, fish and crustaceans (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1983), but also on fish offal and human refuse (Cousins 1998, Conners 2015). During both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods, birds nesting on Tern Island forage widely throughout the North Pacific, including to the distant, productive California Current waters along the west coast of North America (Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kappes <em>et al. </em>2010). In contrast, during the brooding period, birds from Tern Island forage predominantly within 500 to 800 km of the island (Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2002, Conners <em>et al.</em> 2015, Gutowsky <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kappes <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries represents a threat to the majority of the population. Between 1978 and 1992, the population experienced elevated mortality from interactions with high seas drift-nets in the North Pacific (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1993). The estimated bycatch rates of Black-footed Albatrosses has fluctuated over the past 50 years, generally ranging between 6,000 â 10,000 birds per annum (Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007); In 2003, mortality was estimated to be at least 2,000 birds per year in the U.S. pelagic longline fleet based in Hawaii, and a further 6,000 in Japanese/Taiwanese fleets (Lewison and Crowder 2003). Recent observer data from the Hawaii longline fisheries, from 2010 to 2015 indicate the deep set longline fishery captured an estimated 66 to 535 Black-footed Albatrosses each year and the shallow set longline fishery captured an observed 19-49 birds per year. It has been recently estimated that on average 227 Black-footed Albatrosses are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> fisheries (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), which also target Pacific Cod <em>Gadus microcephalus</em> and Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>. Along the west coast of the US, Black-footed Albatrosses interacting with fleets harvesting Sablefish and Pacific Hake <em>Merluccius productus</em> can experience significant mortality risk (Guy <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2012, it was estimated that between 2006 and 2009, from 25 to 128 albatrosses (assumed to all be Black-footed Albatross) were taken annually in Canadaâs Pacific demersal longline groundfish fisheries, with a predicted yearly average mortality of 85 birds (DFO 2012). Bycatch rates in the Japanese and Taiwanese longline fleets are still largely unknown. However, studies on this species have confirmed the impact of fisheries bycatch on survival (VerÃ¡n <em>et al</em>. 2007) and the annual population growth rate (Niel and Lebreton 2005). Tracking studies show that post-breeding birds disperse over large distances to the oceanographic 'transition zone' where they are susceptible to bycatch in the various pelagic longline fleets (Hyrenbach and Dotson 2003, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2006, Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gutowsky <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Within this area, tracking revealed that fishing effort was heavy in the habitats utilised by the species, and that there may be a male bias in the individuals affected by bycatch.</p>  <p>Around the turn of the 20th century, the species suffered sharp declines due to feather hunting (Spennemann 1998). Protective measures and the cessation of feather hunting allowed the population to recover (ACAP 2010).</p>  <p>Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration. The vast majority of the world population nests on islands below 10 m above sea-level and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss of low-lying atolls/islands that are currently used for nesting (Storlazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>  Other potential threats include volcanic eruptions (Harrison 1990), pollution from agricultural effluents and solid waste including organochlorine (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1996, Auman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Guruge <em>et al.</em> 2001), mercury, PCB and DDE (Ludwig <em>et al</em>. 1998, Guruge et <em>al.</em> 2001, Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007) and oil spills (Fefer <em>et al.</em> 1984, NOAA 1992).","<p>The breeding season population is estimated to 69,404 pairs, equivalent to 138,808 breeding individuals (ACAP 2012).</p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Phoebastria nigripes</em> breeds on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), the <strong>U.S. Minor Outlying Islands</strong> and four outlying islands off <strong>Japan.

In total there are estimated to be 70,069 pairs breeding each year (Flint 2007, Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007, ACAP 2017) in at least 16 locations. The largest populations sizes counted were 28,610 pairs counted at Midway Atoll for hatch year 2015 and 24, 565 pairs at Laysan Island for hatch year 2012. Together these two sites represent approximately 72% of the global population as estimated by the highest count for each of 16 sites (12 sites surveyed within the last 10 years) (Flint 2007, Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007, ACAP 2017). On Torishima, 914 chicks were reared from 1,219 pairs in 1998, compared with just 20 in 1964 (Cousins and Cooper 2000). In 2013, 2,060 pairs nested on Torishima (ACAP 2017). The species disperses widely over the northern Pacific Ocean, particularly to the north-east, towards the coastal waters of North America. There have been occasional records in the southern hemisphere (Carboneras 1992, Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hyrenbach and Dotson 2001, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/> All Hawaiian breeding localities are part of the US National Wildlife Refuge and Marine National Monument system or State of Hawaii Seabird Sanctuaries.

It requires water less than 1 m deep for foraging (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although it may frequent shallow brackish waters as long as they provide the cover (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> of submerged, floating, emergent or riparian vegetation, dense reedbeds or overhanging branches (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

During the winter the species may also be found in saline habitats along the coast (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> where water is shallow, fairly sheltered and within site of land (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (e.g. brackish lagoons [Snow and Perrins 1998]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, brackish estuaries [del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998]<strong> </strong>and bays [del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992]<strong><sup></sup></strong>). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is omnivorous and opportunistic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, feeding by dabbling in water and by grazing on the land (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Its diet consists of seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants (e.g. crops) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, as well as terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates (especially in the spring and summer) such as insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms and occasionally amphibians and fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> or bowl of vegetation that can be situated in many different locations such as within vegetation on the ground, in natural tree cavities (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> up to 10 m high (Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, under fallen dead wood, on tree stumps (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, under bushes (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and even in abandoned nests of other species (e.g. herons or crows) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Based on this evidence, it is suspected that the population has declined by at least 20-29% over three generations. Thus the species is classified as Near Threatened.","The Flesh-footed Shearwater mainly occurs in the subtropics over continental shelves and slopes, and occasionally in inshore waters. Individuals also pass through the tropics and over deeper waters when on migration to the North Pacific and Indian Oceans (Brooke 2004). Individuals have been recorded over waters of 13â23Â°C in the south-western Pacific Ocean (Reid 2002) and over waters of 11â16Â°C in the northern Pacific Ocean (Reid 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pairs breed on islands in burrows on sloping ground in coastal forest, scrubland, or grassland (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2007). Nests consist of enlarged chambers at the end of burrows (1-3 metres in length), with the entrance often covered by plant material (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2014).","<p>Records of bycatch in the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) have been very high; 0.38 birds caught per 1,000 hooks and an estimated 8,972 - 18,490 individuals killed in the period 1998-2002 (Baker and Wise 2005), sufficient to be driving significant declines. Considerable levels of bycatch from gill-nets, purse-seines, longlines and inshore trawl have been recorded across the speciesâs range (Japan, Australia, Russia and New Zealand) affecting the great majority of the population. Some mitigation methods have been put in place to reduce incidental capture, however the species is repeatedly found to be amongst the seabirds at greatest risk. In Baker and Wiseâs (2005) findings, 91% of all birds taken were Flesh-footed Shearwaters. From 1992 to 1996, estimates of seabird bycatch rates on Japanese long-line vessels fishing within the southern Australian EEZ varied between 0.1 and 0.3 birds per 1,000 hooks, with Flesh-footed Shearwaters accounting for around 10% of the observed bycatch (Tuck <em>et al.</em> 2003). An additional 677 Flesh-footed Shearwaters are reportedly taken each year in the Japanese neon flying squid driftnet fishery (Ogi 2008) and 116 in the land-based salmon gillnet fishery (DeGange and Day 1991). In New Zealand, the species is frequently captured in commercial fisheries, ranked as the 3rd (out of 70) most at risk in 2013 (based on estimated annual potential fatalities vs. potential biological removal) (Richard and Abraham 2013), and 5th in 2014 (Richard and Abraham 2014). Mortality in the ETBF has evidently declined in recent years, but this is thought to be largely due to the fishery shifting north in 2006/07 due to a change in the targeted fish species (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Consequently, high mortality rates in the ETBF may occur again in future years if the fishery returns south. Recreational fisheries bycatch is also likely to be significant (Tennyson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Data on Flesh-footed Shearwater bycatch in the West and South Coast Purse Seine Managed Fisheries in Western Australia (six vessels operated in 2010) suggest up to six adult birds are killed per day per boat (DEF 2005) with more than 512 birds entangled in one season (Dunlop 2007).</p>  <p>Rapid increases in the incidence of plastic ingestion by chicks over the past decade is suspected to be one of the drivers of decline at Lord Howe Island (90% of tested fledglings contained considerable quantities of plastic [Lavers and Bond 2016]) and in other colonies. Preliminary data from New Zealand indicates around 44% of adult birds contain plastic (Robertson <em>et al. </em>2004). Individuals of all ages have been found to suffer lethal effects. A linear relationship between burrow density and plastic fragments suggests this species is particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution (Buxton <em>et al. </em>2013). High levels of heavy metal contamination (silver, aluminium, copper, mercury, arsenic and cadmium) have been detected in multiple populations and may be co-pollutants linked to plastic consumption (Bond and Lavers 2011, Lavers <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lewis 2016).</p>  <p>The habit of nesting and roosting in burrows on the ground also exposes the Flesh-footed Shearwater to interaction with terrestrial predators and other competitors. In the late 1930s, predation by Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> was deemed responsible for completely eradicating a breeding population from mainland Western Australia (Warham 1958). Introduced House Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> and Brown Rats <em>R. norvegicus</em> are present in parts of the breeding range and have minor effects on egg and chick mortality, representing an added stress factor on reproductive success (Taylor 2000, Gaze 2000, Pridell <em>et al</em>. 2006). On Breaksea Island, shearwaters compete with rabbits for burrows (Lavers 2015). </p>  <p>Several roads pass through or run adjacent to breeding colonies on Lord Howe Island, and mortalities are frequently reported along the roadsides (Hutton 2003, DECC 2008). The density of carcasses adjacent to roads was 25 times greater than elsewhere in the colony, and an estimated 125 birds were killed on roads during the 2008/2009 breeding season (Reid 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2013a). These rates are sufficient to drive slow population declines (Reid <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). The number of cars and tourists are increasing on the Island each year, suggesting this is a growing threat to affected populations. </p>  <p>Extensive areas of Flesh-footed Shearwater habitat have been cleared for residential developments up to the recent past. As a result, the extent of suitable habitat on Lord Howe Island was considerably reduced (down 35% from 37.8 ha in 1978 to 24.3 ha in 2002 [Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2006]), but recent restrictions have been reported to have halted further conversion, despite an apparent continued decline in burrow density (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p></p>","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;650,000 individuals, but this has recently been revised downward following the identification of a number of significant errors in the historical literature, as well as recent population surveys. Overall, the current global population is substantially smaller than previously thought, comprising only around 74,000 breeding pairs (Lavers 2015). In Australia, the population on Lord Howe Island had been estimated at c.20,000-40,000 breeding pairs in 1978 (Fullagar and Disney 1981) and 17,462 breeding pairs in 2003 (Priddel <em>et al.</em> 2003). In 2009, the population was estimated at 16,267 pairs (95%-confidence interval 11,649â21,250), representing a decline in the number of pairs of 6.8% since 2003, equalling a decline of approximately 1.3% per annum (Reid <em>et al. </em>2013). In New Zealand, Robertson and Bell (1984) estimated the breeding population at 50,000-100,000 pairs in 1983, while Taylor (2000) considered the population to be at 25,000-50,000 pairs. Recent surveys suggest the population is closer to 10,000-15,000 pairs (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2010, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Western Australian population was recently uplisted from Least Concern to Vulnerable (DPaW 2015).

Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Large colonies nesting in urban areas are perceived as a public nuisance and may be persecuted (e.g. by disturbance to prevent colony establishment, removal or direct killing) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). European birds may gather in large congregations from the beginning of July in areas such as the Wadden Sea or the Wash to moult (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and some juveniles may remain in the non-breeding range all year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds dispersed or aggregated in loose colonies, and travels in group sizes of up to 1,500 on passage, remaining in large groups (up to hundreds of thousands of birds) throughout the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).<strong> </strong>The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> The provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that recieve &gt; 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species' reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is also known to show increased hatching successes when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001).","<em>Breeding</em> This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog <em>Erinaceus europeaus</em>) on some islands (Jackson 2001). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass <em>Spartina anglica</em> which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002b).

The loss of rafts used for breeding represents a source of lost reproductive success, as shown by increases in breeding populations on the provisioning of artificial rafts (Gochfeld <em>et al.</em> 2018). Drought also has the potential to reduce reproductive success, as lower water levels allow the access of chicks by predators such as pigs. Encroachment of agriculture on wetlands has resulted in further loss and degradation of habitat. Introduction of the peacock bass to Lake Gutan in Panama resulted in the elimination of the Silverside, <em>Meleniris chagresi,</em> a significant prey species of the Black Tern, causing abandonment of this wintering site (Gochfeld <em>et al. </em>2018).<p></p>","The global population is estimated at 800,000-1,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birdsâ survival (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007).&#160;It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006).","The global population is estimated to number  c.140,000 individuals which equates to 93,300 mature individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013).&#160;The European population is estimated at 14,900-28,800 pairs, which equates to 29,700-57,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

The species breeds between April and June (northern Hemisphere) or between September and December (southern Hemisphere) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) in large dense monospecific colonies or as single pairs or small groups (2-3 pairs) amidst large colonies of other species (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is not a highly gregarious species outside of the breeding season but may aggregate into flocks on passage, and during the winter it may feed in loose congregations&#160;in rich fishing areas or at nightly roost sites (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>1986, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<strong>Habitat</strong> The breeding, passage and wintering habitats of this species are similar, although during the winter it is largely confined to the coast (Shuford and Craig 2002). It frequents sheltered sea coasts, estuaries, inlets, bays, harbours, coastal lagoons, saltmarshes&#160;and saltpans, also occurring inland on fresh or saline wetlands including large lakes, inland seas, large rivers, creeks, floodlands, reservoirs&#160;and sewage ponds (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Martin and Randall 1987, Richards 1990, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). When breeding the species shows a preference for nesting on sandy, shell-strewn or shingle beaches, sand-dunes, flat rock-surfaces, sheltered reefs or islands&#160;with sparse vegetation and flat or gently sloping margins surrounded by clear, shallow, undisturbed waters (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It also forms winter roosts on sandbars, mudflats and banks of shell (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish 5-25 cm in length also including the eggs and young of other birds, carrion, aquatic invertebrates (e.g. crayfish), flying insects and earthworms (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Shuford and Craig 2002).&#160;<strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression in the sand, gravel, shells, sparse vegetation&#160;or dried mud of ridges, beaches, dunes, flat rocky or stony islets, banks, islands or reefs in seas, lakes and large rivers, dredge spoil piles and islands in reservoirs (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Richards 1990, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species nests in large colonies or as single pairs or small groups amidst colonies of other species, neighbouring nests placed between 0.7 and 4 m part (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species may forage up to 60 km from the site of the breeding colony (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Management information</strong> Management for this species should include a number of measures such as habitat and vegetation management, the use of artificial nest substrates, predator management (e.g. control of gull populations) and the minimisation of disturbance (Shuford and Craig 2002). Habitat and vegetation management may include the creation of artificial islands with calm water on their leeward side to allow the growth of submerged vegetation and fish spawning habitats, or alternatively the creation of floating artificial nesting-rafts (e.g. barges covered with sand) (Shuford and Craig 2002).","Human disturbance represents a significant threat to this species. Caspian Tern colonies are especially vulnerable to disturbance during the early courtship and incubation stages, during which human visitation results in the flushing of the whole colony, potentially leading to nest or colony abandonment (Cuthbert and Wires 1999 per Shuford and Craig 2002). The effect of disturbance during research activities has been well quantified, with activities such as ringing and cannon-netting representing a large proportion of the reproductive failure in colonies studied (Shuford and Craig 2002). Disturbance due to recreational activities are less well quantified but likely also significant (Shuford and Craig 2002). Much of the loss of reproductive success due to human disturbance occurs through gull predation of chicks during the few seconds of panic flight in which the eggs and chicks of a nest are left exposed (Shuford and Craig 2002). Historically, overexploitation has resulted in large population declines through the collection of eggs and adults for food and feathers (Shuford and Craig 2002). Shooting of birds is still thought to occur, but on a much smaller scale than in the past&#160;(Shuford and Craig 2002).","The global   population is estimated to number c.250,000-470,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 11,800-14,800 pairs, which equates to 23,600-29,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;National population estimates include: c.50-1,000   individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China;   c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in   Taiwan; &lt; c.50 individuals on migration and &lt; c.50 wintering   individuals in Japan and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000   individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Increasing,"This species has a cosmopolitan but scattered distribution.

Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor threat. However shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean, notably in Malta, as well as wintering birds in tropical regions including Latin America and the West Indies (Global Raptor Information Network 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a strongly migratory coastal seabird (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds between April and June in solitary pairs or colonially in groups of up to several thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Palearctic breeders migrate south after breeding between August and October, returning to the breeding grounds in March or April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species may moult on arrival in its the wintering grounds, when it may become vulnerable to human exploitation (van Halewyn and Norton 1984). It is gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998). Shoals of fish may attract dense feeding flocks, although it otherwise feeds singly or in small loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In some cases, it is territorial; in Massachusetts, feeding territories usually consist of linear strips of shoreline, which are occupied and defended regularly by both members of a pair. The prevalence of territoriality at feeding sites varies between colonies and is related to food species availability (Nisbet 1983). Most individuals forage 5-10 km from breeding colonies, occasionally feeding at sea 15 km offshore (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Common Terns forage over fresh water as well as marine habitats, and often follow predatory fish, waiting for panicking baitfish to surface. They sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks together with other terns (Safina 1990, Brenninkmeijer <em>et al. </em>2002).<strong> <br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in a wide variety of habitats in coastal and inland areas from sea-level to heights of greater than 4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Along the coast, it shows a preference for nesting on flat rock surfaces on inshore islands, open shingle and sandy beaches, dunes and spits, vegetated inter-dune areas, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in estuaries and coastal lagoons, saltmarshes, mainland peninsulas and grassy plateaus atop coastal cliffs (Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Inland, it may nest in similar habitats, including sand or shingle lakes shores, shingle banks in rivers, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in lakes and rivers, sand- or gravel-pits, marshes, ponds, grassy areas and patches of dredged soil (Richards 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).<strong> </strong><em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on sheltered coastal waters, estuaries and along large rivers, occupying harbours, jetties, piers, beaches and coastal wetlands including lagoons, rivers, lakes, swamps and saltworks, mangroves and saltmarshes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). During this season, it roosts on unvegetated sandy beaches, shores of estuaries or lagoons, sandbars and rocky shores (Higgins and Davies 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> The species is opportunistic, its diet consisting predominantly of small fish and occasionally planktonic crustaceans and insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression on open substrates with little or no vegetation placed near a vertical object (e.g. rock, shell, plant or artefact) to provide shelter for chicks and to facilitate nest identification (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Nest sites include the edges of bare sand amongst vegetation, rocks or logs, open areas on the margins of vegetation on beaches, the edges of mats of vegetation in marshes, and grassy or rocky substrates on rocky islets (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species will also readily nest on artificial rafts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Foraging range </strong>Studies have observed foraging birds at up to 37 km from the nearest colony (Cramp 1985, BirdLife International 2000). However, although Common Terns tend to range further than Roseate Terns (BirdLife International 2000), most are observed within 10 km of a breeding colony (Becker <em>et al.</em> 1993, Wanless <em>et al.</em> 1998, Newton and Crowe 1999). At various sites, visual observations, e.g. of direction of flight, also suggest that most feeding trips are to sites within 10 km of the colony (Hopkins and Wiley 1972, Duffy 1986, Uttley <em>et al.</em> 1989, Burness <em>et al.</em> 1994, BirdLife International 2000), although birds in these studies were recorded at a maximum of 18 km from the colony (Duffy 1986). Radio-tagging at the Wadden Sea has shown that birds forage at a mean radius of at least 6.3 km (Becker <em>et al.</em> 1993), although the total distance travelled by individuals on these foraging trips is much greater, around 26-30 km. In Massachusetts, feeding territories tend to be located in shallow water up to 75 m from shore, and may be at least 8.5 km away from the breeding colony (Lemmetyinen 1973, Nisbet 1983, BirdLife International 2000), as well as areas where depth changes abruptly and tidal currents are strong, which presumably produces much upwelling and mixing of cold, deep water with warmer surface water (Safina 1990). Birds lower the rate at which they attempt to forage when windspeed is high (Taylor 1983).","<p>During the breeding season, the species is vulnerable to human disturbance at nesting colonies (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991), with sources of disturbance including off-road vehicles, recreation, motor-boats, personal watercraft and dogs (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Hyde 1997, Burger 1998, Gochfeld <em>et al.</em> 2018). The flooding of nest sites as a result of naturally fluctuating water levels can also result in complete breeding failure of the effected colony (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld<em> et al.</em> 2018). Previously, this species has experienced significant declines due to egging, hunting and the millinery trade (Gochfeld <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although in most places populations have recovered, hunting remains a significant problem in some areas, including parts of West Africa, where human predation results in a fledging success rate of only 12% (Gochfeld <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>","The global population is estimated to number c.1,600,000-3,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 316,000-605,000 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species has a circumpolar distribution and can be found breeding in most of Europe, Asia and North America, except the in the extreme north.

Breeding efforts were essentially zero in 1978, 1983, 1990 and 1992, likely caused by reduced prey availability associated with El NiÃ±o-events. Pelagic Cormorants are one of the first species to leave young exposed and/or abandon nesting attempts entirely. Therefore, climate-induced changes in food resources may increase adult mortality and result in behavioural changes which increase the risk of nest predation (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2001).<br/>Camera monitoring of a sub-colony in California (AÃ±o Nuevo Island) revealed high frequency of raven <em>Corvus corax</em> visits, interaction with all nests and removal of (at least) 3.3 eggs per nest over a period of 101 days. Carle <em>et al. </em>(2017) attributed the low breeding success to egg depredation by ravens. A single pair of breeding ravens was deemed responsible, and there were large mismatches in hatching success between adjacent colonies.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. Assuming a 31-year generation time, the 3-generation window for criterion A is the period 1926-2018. The global mature population size in 1926 was probably around 140,000. The current global mature population size is uncertain but likely to be in the range 5,000-15,000. This corresponds to a reduction of 89%-97%, which overlaps the boundary of Critically Endangered and Endangered with respect to past reduction under the A1 criterion (90% reduction over three generations). Given the evidence of increase in those regions where the species was most depleted (Antarctic and North Atlantic), Endangered (A1abd) seems the most appropriate category at this time, taking into account both the current population level and the likely global trend. The dominant contribution to the reduction in the global population was the massive reduction of the formerly very large Antarctic population. The Antarctic subspecies (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>)&#160;is included in this assessment, but is also separately listed as Critically Endangered.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Blue Whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill), with a variety of species being taken by different Blue Whale populations, such as <em>Euphausia superba</em> in the Antarctic, <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> off southern Australia (Gill 2002), <em>Euphausia recurva</em> off Western Australia (J. Bannister pers. comm. 2007), <em>Nyctiphanes simplex</em> off the GalÃ¡pagos (Palacios 1999), <em>Euphausia pacifica</em> and <em>Thysanoessa</em> spp. in the North Pacific (Fiedler <em>et al.</em> 1998), and <em>Meganyctiphanes norvegica </em>and <em>Thysanoessa </em>spp. in the North Atlantic (Visser <em>et al.</em> 2011, McQuinn <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed both at the surface and at depths of up to 300 m (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Calambokidis <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The migration patterns of Blue Whales are not well understood, but appear to be diverse. Although there is evidence of migratory behaviour in most of the populations studied, both wintering and summering areas appear to be occupied at some level throughout the year. Some individuals may reside year-round in habitats of year-round high productivity, while others undertake long migrations from tropical waters to high-latitude feeding grounds, but possibly stopping to feed in areas of high productivity on route, while yet others may undertake more limited migrations (Branch <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Gill <em>et al.</em> 2011, de Vos <em>et al.</em> 2014, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013, Torres 2013, Lesage <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>The main threat to Blue Whales in the past was direct exploitation, which only became possible on a regular basis in the modern era using deck-mounted harpoon cannons. Modern Blue Whale hunting started in the North Atlantic in 1868 and spread to other regions after the northeastern Atlantic population had been severely reduced, and whaling was temporarily banned in Norway from 1905 and in Iceland from 1915 (TÃ¸nnessen and Johnsen 1982). The Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were each probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased in the 1960-1970s, but have increased since. Blue Whales have been legally protected worldwide since 1966, although they continued to be caught illegally by former USSR fleets until 1972. The last recorded deliberate catches were off Spain in 1978 (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Blue Whales in a calving ground off southern Sri Lanka appears to be especially subject to ship strikes, as indicated by both direct observations of strikes and strandings that exhibit blunt trauma (Ilangakoon 2012, de Vos <em>et al</em>. 2016) and observations of living animals that appear to have injuries that prevent normal swimming (IWC 2018b). The large volume of ship traffic around the southern coast of Sri Lanka makes it one of the busiest ocean-going shipping lanes in the world, but Priyadasharnha <em>et al.</em> (2016)&#160;showed that the expected frequency of ship strikes on Blue Whales would be greatly reduced by moving the lanes slightly further offshore.<br/><br/>Nine deaths of Blue Whales plus some serious injuries were attributed to ship strikes on the west coast of North America during 2007-13 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Of 21 carcasses of Blue Whales found off California during 1988-2007, eight were found to have been killed by ship strike (Berman-Kowalewski <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;This suggests that ship strikes represent a substantial addition to natural mortality (Rockwood <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Monnahan <em>et al</em>. (2015), on the other hand, argued that ship strikes have only a small effect on this population.&#160;As of 2018 this issue had not been resolved.<br/><br/>Of the Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence photo-identification catalogue, 16% appear to have scars or wounds resulting from ship strikes (Sears and Calambokidis 2002).<br/><br/>McKenna <em>et al.</em> (2015) concluded from tracking data that Blue Whales do not demonstrate effective avoidance behaviour when ships are near.&#160;However, Priyardashana <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed, based on densities of whales and shipping, that the expected frequency of ship strikes off southern Sri Lanka would be an order of magnitude higher than current estimates if the Blue Whales took no evasive action.<br/><br/>Incidental catches of Blue Whales in fisheries appear to be rare. The only reported cases this century were one in the northeastern Pacific in 2015 and one in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 2002. Blue whales in cold waters often have marks or scars caused by contact with ice, which can make it harder to identify scars caused by contact with fishing gear.<br/><br/>The main food of Antarctic Blue Whales, <em>Euphausia superba</em> and <em>E. crystallorophias</em><em>,</em> are predicted to decline during the 21<sup>st</sup> century due both to reduced ocean productivity associated with warming (PiÃ±ones and Fedorov 2016) and to increasing ocean acidity that limits their shell-building (Kawaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160; Comparable changes are likely in other oceans.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Nearly 11,000 Blue Whales were specifically recorded as taken in the North Atlantic since the start of modern whaling in northern Norway in the 1860s, but an additional 13,000 unspecified large whales were recorded as caught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Allison 2017), of which perhaps 30% could have been Blue Whales based on specified catches in the same areas in the same and following years. In addition, whaling in the earlier years (pre-1916) is thought to have involved substantial struck-and-lost rates (IWC 2010, 2017b) such that the total number of Blue Whales killed in the North Atlantic was probably in the range 15-20,000.<br/><br/>Catches started off the coast of Finnmark, northern Norway, where it is likely that over 3,000 Blue Whales were taken before whaling was banned from mainland Norway in 1905. Operations spread to Svalbard, where over 1,000 Blue Whales were taken, and to Iceland where probably over 5,000 were taken before whaling was banned for about 20 years starting in 1916 due to noticeably declining abundance. Over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken off Newfoundland, about 500 in the Gulf of St Lawrence and nearly 1,000 around the Faeroes, Scotland, and Ireland. Very few Blue Whales were caught off Spain and Portugal. After the main period of whaling, low-level catches throughout the range probably impeded recovery until catches all but ceased around 1960. The last recorded directed catches  were six Blue  Whales taken off Spain in 1978,  three by pirate whaling vessels, and three  by catchers boats working for land stations (Allison  2017).<br/><br/>Post-whaling abundance estimates for the central and eastern North Atlantic (Iceland, Denmark Strait, southeastern Greenland, Jan Mayen, Faeroes and the British Isles and the Norwegian and Barents Seas) rose from 298 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.25) in 1987 to 1,012 (CV 0.23) in 2001 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2009). The increasing trend is consistent with a previous trend detected in sighting rates from Icelandic whaling vessels during 1969-88 (SigurjÃ³nsson and Gunnlaugsson 1990). The Blue Whales in these surveys were most abundant west of Iceland, but with a shift to the northeast of Iceland in recent years (VÃ­kingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Blue Whales are now very rare along the coast of Norway despite large catches there in the past. Further surveys of this area were conducted in 2007 and 2014-16 but the data have not yet been analysed to produce updated estimates of Blue Whale abundance (NAMMCO 2017).<br/><br/>Too few Blue Whales were observed in a survey of the Canadian Atlantic in 2007 to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009) and none were seen in US waters in 2011 surveys (Palka 2012).<br/><br/>Only one Blue Whale was seen (west of Cap Finisterre) during the summer 2016 SCANS III surveys which covered UK waters, the North Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay, and the Atlantic waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). By comparison, over 1,000 Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) were seen. These results suggest a Blue Whale summer abundance in the area only in the tens. A separate survey of waters south-west of Ireland in 2013 (Baines <em>et al.</em> 2017) recorded16 Blue Whales (including resightings), and the data suggest that about 10-20 individuals were present. A Blue Whale seen in southeastern Biscaya in 2016 was the first live sighting off Spain since the last catches in the 1970s (Covelo <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/><br/>About 500 individual Blue Whales were photo-identified in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during 1979-2015 (Sears <em>et al.</em> 2015). In view of the long time period, many of the animals in the catalogue are likely no longer alive. The Northeast Atlantic photo-id catalogue contained over 500 individuals by 2015, including 125 collected off Iceland during 1995-2005 and 335 in the Azores during 2002-15. The catalogues have not yet yielded estimates of abundance.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em></strong><br/>About 9,000 Blue Whales were recorded as caught in the North Pacific, in addition to over 7,000 unspecified whales, some of which would have been Blue Whales (Allison 2017). The Blue Whale was protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1966, but a further 760 Blue Whales were taken illegally by USSR fleets until 1972 (Doroshenko 2000, Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/>The best estimate of abundance for the eastern North Pacific population, from&#160;photographic capture-recapture with an allowance for heterogeneity, is 1,647 (CV 0.07) (Calambokidis and Barlow 2013). Using the estimated catch history, including the assignment of a portion of the past catches in the Gulf of Alaska to the eastern North Pacific population, Monnahan <em>et al. </em>(2015) concluded that the eastern North Pacific population had recovered to near its pre-whaling abundance, estimated to be 1,750-2,500 whales. The population seems to have been roughly stable since the early 1990s (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The international POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) surveys covered the North Pacific east of 170Â°E and north of 40Â°N up to the Aleutian chain and the Alaska coast during 2010-12 (IWC 2018a). A total of 16 Blue Whales were seen. No abundance estimate has been calculated but the survey results suggest an abundance in the range 500-1,500, but which possibly includes some of the animals that are included in the above mark-recapture estimate. Only one Blue Whale was seen during the 2013-16 POWER surveys which covered the area between 20Â°N and 40Â°N. No Blue Whales were sighted in surveys of coastal British Columbia waters during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the northwestern Pacific, Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the late summer abundance in 2008 west of 170Â°E and north of 35Â°N at about 1,000 whales (CV ~0.5). The survey did not include the waters within the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone along the Kuril chain and Kamchatka, where Blue Whales also occur in summer (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Blue Whales remain rare or absent in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Miyashita 2006, Friday et al. 2013), and very few historical catches are recorded from these areas.<br/><br/>Although over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken by coastal whaling in Japan until the 1960s, no Blue Whales were seen around Japan and in the North Pacific west of 155Â°E in extensive scouting vessel surveys during 1964-90 (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160; Blue Whales were seen from 145Â°E eastward in surveys conducted during 1994-2015, but not near the coast of Japan (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern South Pacific and eastern equatorial Pacific</strong></em><br/>A total of 5,276 Blue Whales were reported as caught in the eastern South Pacific including equatorial waters in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Allison 2017). Allowing for some Blue Whales among the unspecified catches and for some level of struck and lost animals, and a lack of catch records for some whaling operations, the likely total kill is in the range 6,000-7,000. However, about 1,000 animals which were taken in equatorial waters during the austral summer/northern winter may have consisted partly of animals from the North Pacific populations. Furthermore, in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Antarctic Blue Whales were much more abundant than today, hence a significant portion of early catches off Peru and Chile, especially in the austral winter, may have been of Antarctic Blue Whales.<br/><br/>For the first 60 years of modern whaling, catches of Blue Whales off Chile and Peru averaged only 60 per year but catches increased from 1964 for meat exports, and 964 whales were taken during 1964-67, between 19Â°-39Â°S. Following a recommendation by the ComisiÃ³n Permanente del PacÃ­fico Sur (the international body responsible for regulating whaling in the southeastern Pacific at the time) (CPSS 1966) catching of Blue Whales were suspended in Peru after the 1966 season and in Chile after the 1966/67 season. Clarke <em>et al</em>. (1978) cited the high catches off Peru and Chile at a time when the Antarctic Blue Whale stock was reduced to less than 1,000, as evidence that the Chilean and Peruvian whales were not from the Antarctic population, an observation that was later confirmed (see <em>Geographic Range</em> above). Sighting rates of Blue Whales from Peruvian and Chilean whaling vessels apparently remained reasonably high after catches of this species ceased (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Maturana 1982), but the high catches of the mid-1960s would probably have been unsustainable if they had been allowed to continue.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the IDCR (International Decade of Cetacean Research) programme in November-December 1982 between 10Â°S and 10Â°N from the coasts of Peru and Ecuador out to 110Â°W resulted in 16 Blue Whale sightings, all within 100 nm of the coast (Donovan 1984), but the survey coincided with the onset of an especially severe El NiÃ±o event.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the international SOWER (Southern Ocean Whale and Environmental Research) programme during December-January 1997/98 covered the area between 12-200nm off the Chile coast between 18Â°S and 38Â°S and resulted in an abundance estimate of 303 Blue Whales (95% confidence interval (CI) = 176-625) for this area (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most Blue Whale sightings were between 27Â°S-33Â°S.&#160; A mark-recapture estimate using photo-id data collected around ChiloÃ© Island (42Â°S) during 2004-11 yielded an estimate of 450 whales (CV 0.17) in 2008 with no significant trend (Cooke and Jackson 2017) but it is unclear what population this estimate pertains to because it includes both resident and transient individuals. Only one match was found between the 23 âindividualsâ (actually: left or right sides) identified on the SOWER cruise and the 563 âindividualsâ identified around ChiloÃ© Island&#160;(IWC 2017a), which suggests that the whales either belong to distinct groups or to quite a large common population. Likewise, only one match was found between the ChiloÃ© whales and the Blue Whales individually identified off ChaÃ±aral (29Â°S) (Galletti Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2017). The overall abundance and trend of Chilean Blue Whales is currently uncertain. Williams <em>et al</em>.

From a survey in December 1996, Best <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales in a survey area south of Madagascar to be 424 (confidence limits about 190-930) and suggested, based on the distribution of past catches, that the total population in the southwestern Indian Ocean was about three times that in the survey area. The Western Australia population has been estimated&#160;at 662-1,559 based on acoustic recordings during 2000-2006 (McCauley and Jenner 2010), and 712-1,754 based on photo-identification during 2000-2005 (Jenner <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, these estimates do not cover the full range of the species in the southeastern Indian Ocean, and updated estimates based on photo-identification and genetic recapture are in preparation (IWC 2017a). A total of 31 distinct blue whales were identified in New Zealand waters during 2004-2014 (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and a population estimate is currently in preparation. The catch of over 9,500 Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean in the period 1960-72 (Allison 2017) suggests that the initial population was at least this size, and hence that the current population is still depleted, but not as severely as that of the Antarctic Blue Whale.<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Mikhalev (2000) documented 1,294 Pygmy Blue Whales caught illegally by Soviet fleets in the northern and equatorial Indian Ocean during 1963-66, mainly in the Gulf of Aden, north of the Seychelles, off the Maldive Islands and Laccdive Islands, and west of southern India and Sri Lanka. Priyadarshana <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated a population size of 270 whales (CV 0.09) in a 7,500 kmÂ² area off southern Sri Lanka, which probably does not cover the full extent of this area of occurrence. No other abundance estimates in the Northern Indian Ocean are available.<em><br/><br/><strong>Antarctic</strong></em><br/>Catch records did not distinguish between subspecies until biologists accompanying Japanese and Russian whaling fleets started recording them separately from the 1960s (Ichihara 1966, Doroshenko 2000). Branch <em>et al.</em> (2009) concluded that virtually all of the Blue Whales taken south of 52Â°S in the southern Indian Ocean sector were Antarctic Blue Whales. The catch history of the various subspecies can be approximately reconstructed by assuming that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken south of 52Â°S or in the South Atlantic were <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, that Blue Whales taken off the west coast of South America were Chilean Blue Whales, and that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken in the northern Indian Ocean or in the Indian Ocean or the western South Pacific north of 52Â°S in the austral summer were Pygmy Blue Whales (understood here to include both <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> and <em>B. m. indica</em>). This leaves just a few hundred early catches in the southern Indian Ocean of doubtful identity.<em> </em>Allowing for some of the unspecified (to species) catch to have been Blue Whales, and for some struck and lost whales in the early years, the estimated total historical kill is about 350,000 Antarctic Blue Whales and 14,000 Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B .m. brevicauda</em> and/or <em>B. m. indica</em>). These figures include the approximately 9,400 Blue Whales taken illegally by Soviet fleets in the 1960s and early 1970s that were not reported at the time (Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2011), of which about 80% were Pygmy Blue Whales based on the above criteria.<br/><br/>The most recent circumpolar estimate of abundance for Antarctic Blue Whales agreed by the IWC Scientific Committee is 2,280 (CV 0.36) in 1998, based on sightings south of 60Â°S in summer, with an estimated annual increase rate of 8.1% (95% CI 1.6%-14.9%) (Branch 2007). A recalculation of the increase rate using more years of data is in progress (IWC 2017a).<br/><br/>An estimate from Japanese surveys covering just half of the Antarctic (35Â°E to 145Â°W) south of 60Â° S is 1,223 (CV 0.35) in 2008, with an estimated annual increase rate reported as 8.3% (95% CI 3.9% - 12.5%) (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). However, the annual increase rate implied by the presented data is 6.6% with a wide confidence interval (95% CI 0.0%-13.2%).<br/><br/>Photo-identification of Antarctic Blue Whales during 1991-2016 yielded 441 distinct individuals of which 14 were re-sighted in different years (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; The number of inter-annual re-sightings is too small for reliable estimation of abundance and trends, but is broadly consistent with the above circumpolar abundance estimate.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Assessment</em></strong><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee in 2008 accepted a stock assessment of Antarctic Blue Whales by T. Branch (IWC 2009). However, the assessment is redone here because the Committee's assessment did not use an age-structured model and thus could not estimate the numbers of mature individuals that are required for the IUCN Red List assessment. The historical catch data have also been revised since then (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>The age at first reproduction is not well-known for Blue Whales in general, but Sears <em>et al.</em> (2013) found a youngest age of 11 years for first known calvings of female Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific. This agrees with the estimate of 11 years  by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) from inter-specific comparisons. The generation time was estimated by Taylor <em>et al.</em> to be 30.8 years, which corresponds to a 3-generation period from 1926-2018 for application of the A criterion for the Red List.<br/><br/>Plausible rates of natural increase, taking into account the age at maturity and reproductive rates have been estimated to be 4.1% per year (Branch 2008a) for Antarctic Blue Whales and 2% per year for Pygmy Blue Whales, which appear to have a lower reproductive rate (Branch 2008b). Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) inferred an intrinsic increase rate of 5% for Blue Whales and estimated the proportion mature to be 72% for a stable population or 48% for a population increasing at the intrinsic rate.    </p><p>For Antarctic Blue Whales, a 5% intrinsic increase rate with logistic density-dependence, and&#160;assuming a 5 year mean age at recruitment, as for Fin Whales, an annual natural survival rate of 0.975 (Ramp <em>et al.</em> 2006, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 2,280 whales in 1998, would imply a mature population size in 1926 of 125,000 or a total population size of 189,000, declining to a minimum of less than 1,000 in the late 1960s, and increasing to about 3,000 mature or 6,500 total by 2018 (see Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>As discussed above, there are no complete estimates of recent or current abundance for the other regions, but plausible total numbers would be 1,000-3,000 in the North Atlantic, 3,000-5,000 in the North Pacific, and possibly 1,000-3,000 in the eastern South Pacific. The number of Pygmy Blue whales is very uncertain but may be in the range 2,000-5,000. Taken together with a range of 5,000-8,000 in the Antarctic, the global population size in 2018 is plausibly in the range 10,000-25,000 total or 5,000-15,000 mature, compared with a 1926 global population of at least 140,000 mature. The current mature population would therefore be between 3 and 11% of the 1926 level. This overlaps the boundary (90% decline or 10% remaining) between the Endangered and Critically Endangered categories under criterion A1.<br/><br/>There is evidence of increasing abundance, at least up to around the year 2000, in the Antarctic and North Atlantic, and at least stability in the North Pacific. There is as yet no evidence of trend in the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales or of Chilean Blue Whales, but it is likely that the global population of Blue Whales has increased in recent decades.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Blue Whale is a cosmopolitan species, found in all oceans but absent from some regional seas such as the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering seas. Until the 1960s, evidence of Blue Whale distribution came primarily from commercial catches, subsequently from whaling vessels sightings, then in the 1980s and 1990s from dedicated sighting surveys and platforms of opportunity, and since the 2000s also from acoustic detections, especially of males.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em><br/> </em></strong>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution of Blue Whales extends in the west from the Scotian Shelf to the Davis Strait (Canada/Greenland) and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2010). Blue whales occur in the Denmark Strait, around Iceland and north to the ice edge, and in the northeast to and around Svalbard (Norway), but not far into the Barents Sea. Historically, Blue Whales were commonly caught along the coasts of northern and western Norway, the Faeroes, and to the north and west of Scotland and Ireland. Small numbers were caught off northwestern Spain&#160;and near the Strait of Gibraltar, but the species does not occur in the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>The winter distribution is poorly known but Blue Whales may have been dispersed over much of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2004). There have been winter sightings off the coast of Mauritania (Baines and Reichelt 2014).&#160; Blue Whales are regularly observed around the Azores in spring and at least some migrate northward from there (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2013). Blue Whales have been tracked from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the New England Seamounts and to the coasts of North and South Carolina (34Â°N) in winter (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are virtually no records from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Photo-identification data show that there are two largely separate populations in the North Atlantic: the northwest Atlantic population occurs in summer in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the Scotian Shelf, and around Newfoundland and west of Greenland. The northeast Atlantic population occurs in summer east of Greenland, around Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard, and west of Ireland; in spring it occurs around the Azores and in winter off northwest Africa. About 500 individuals have been identified to date in each of the two populations, but so far only one crossover (from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the Azores) has been documented through photographic matching (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2015.<em><br/><br/><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/></strong><em></em>Blue Whales occur in summer north of 35Â°N in the western North Pacific, and north of 40Â°N in the central North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska, but not in the Bering or Okhotsk Seas. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur year-round off Baja California, Mexico, and the California coast (Calambokidis and Barlow 2004). Analysis of song types suggest that Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific are a separate population from those in the central and western North Pacific, but that whales from the eastern population mingle with whales from the western population in the Gulf of Alaska in summer (Monnahan <em>et al</em>. 2014). While some Blue Whales remain off California in winter, some of the Californian Blue Whales, including females with or without calves, migrate into the Gulf of California in winter (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2013). Some North Pacific Blue Whales migrate in winter to the Costa Rica dome (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1999)&#160; and perhaps further south into Peruvian waters (Le Duc <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and eastern South Pacific</strong></em><br/>Blue Whales are present year-round on the Costa Rica Dome but it is unclear whether any animals are resident there, or whether it is sequentially occupied by whales wintering from the northeastern and southeastern Pacific (Reilly and Thayer 1990).<br/><br/>Sightings recorded by whalers taking other species show that Blue Whales were quite abundant during 1976-82 in the waters west of northern Peru (exact locations not given), especially in January-March, but with much reduced presence during the severe El NiÃ±o event of 1982-83 (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Donovan 1984). Their presence in November-December from the coast out to well beyond the GalÃ¡pagos Islands was also shown by sightings from Japanese scouting vessels during 1979-82 (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). Their presence in the waters of Ecuador and Peru was shown by tuna vessel surveys during October-March 1975-88 (Reilly and Thayer 1990) and later by dedicated cetacean surveys in July-December during 1986-2003 (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Blue Whales have been hunted in the past from several locations on the Chilean coast from 20Â°S to 42Â°S in all seasons (Allison 2017). Current areas of regular summer abundance include ChaÃ±aral (29Â°S) and ChiloÃ© Island (42Â°-44Â°S) (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2012). A summer survey in December-January 1997/98 of offshore waters 12-200 nm from the coast between 18Â°S and 38Â°S showed presence from 20Â°S southward, with most sightings between 27Â°S and 33Â°S (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Based on morphology, genetics and migration, Branch <em>et al</em>. (2007a) proposed that Chilean Blue Whales are a separate subspecies from <em>B. m. intermedia </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em>. However, while Chilean Blue Whales are clearly distinct from the other Southern Hemisphere subspecies, the division between Chilean and North Pacific Blue Whales is not yet clear. LeDuc <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that most Blue Whales biopsy sampled during July-November on the Costa Rica Dome were genetically closer to whales sampled in the North Pacific, while most Blue Whales biopsy sampled in the same months off Ecuador and the GalÃ¡pagos were genetically closer to whales sampled in Chilean waters, but there was a high degree of uncertainty in individual assignments to the two groups. There is movement between the two grounds, with individual whales matched or tracked between California and the Costa Rica Dome, between the Costa Rica Dome and the GalÃ¡pagos, and between the GalÃ¡pagos and southern Chile (IWC 2017a, Huecke-Gate <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Chilean waters, the seasonal distribution of acoustic detections suggests a migration to northerly tropical latitudes in winter, but calls typical of Chilean Blue Whales were also recorded year-round in the ETP (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2015). Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales are detected in the ETP during the austral winter (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 1999, IWC 2017a). Clearly more research is needed to clarify the seasonal presence and distribution of the different groups of Blue Whales in the ETP, as the area is used by North Pacific, Chilean, and Antarctic Blue Whales, and there may also be resident individuals.<br/><br/>Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales have also been detected from January to June near ChiloÃ© Island, but appeared to be from individuals making only brief visits to the area (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific</strong></em><br/><br/>Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B. m. brevicauda</em>) occur north of 52Â°S, with very few or no individuals south of this latitude (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). They occur off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2016), on the Madagascar plateau (Best <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the offshore waters of Kenya (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016) around and north of the Seychelles (Mikhalev 2000), across the pelagic southern Indian Ocean, and off South Australia and Western Australia, where they form part of a more or less continuous distribution from Tasmania to Indonesia. The Blue Whales observed around New Zealand also appear to be Pygmy Blue whales, based on genetics (Sremba <em>et al</em>. 2015) and morphology (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Blue Whales appear to be rare or absent in the central South Pacific between the New Zealand and Chilean areas of occurrence (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b).<br/><br/>Based on acoustic detections, Antarctic Blue Whales (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>) occur in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean only in winter and spring, while Pygmy Blue Whales occur year-round but with a tendency to move southward in the austral summer (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other data are also broadly consistent with a lower-latitude distribution in the austral winter and a more southerly distribution in summer (Zemsky and Sazhinov 1982, cited by Best <em>et al</em>. 2003): Pygmy Blue Whales were present at the Seychelles in November but not April (Mikhalev 2000), and off Kenya in September and October but not during November to January (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016). Foetuses found in the Pygmy Blue Whales taken by Soviet whalers near the Seychelles and in the southern Indian Ocean indicated that calves are born in the austral winter (Mikhalev 2000).<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><strong> </strong><br/>Blue Whales are found year-round in the northern Indian Ocean, especially around Sri Lanka, and seasonally around the Maldive Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (Alling <em>et al</em>. 1991, Mikhaelev 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2011, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). They occur virtually year-round off southern Sri Lanka but are most abundant during December to May and least abundant during July to September (Randage <em>et al</em>. 2014). Analyses of fetuses in Blue Whales taken by Soviet fleets in the Northern Indian Ocean (Mikhalev 2000) revealed no clear seasonality of reproduction, being consistent either with year-round reproduction or perhaps a bimodal pattern.<br/><br/>Anderson <em>et al</em>. (2012) considered that there is some east-west migration within the northern Indian Ocean, with peak occurrence in the western Arabian Sea in May-October, followed by dispersal eastward after the end of the southwest monsoon, past Sri Lanka and into the Bay of Bengal, with peak abundance northeast of Sri Lanka occurring in February and March. However, Samaran <em>et al</em>. (2013) found that call types detected off Sri Lanka were also heard in the southern Indian Ocean in December and January, at least as far south as 43Â°S, which suggests that some Blue Whales may migrate between Sri Lanka and the temperate southern Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are tentatively considered to be the distinct subspecies <em>B. m. indica</em>, their distinction from <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> is unclear. Mikhalev (2000) found the maximum body length, body length at maturity, and ovulation rate of Arabian Sea Blue Whales to be similar to Pygmy Blue Whales in the Southern Indian Ocean.<br/></p><strong><em>Antarctic and Southern Ocean</em></strong><br/>The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, occurs throughout the Antarctic in summer, from the Antarctic Polar Front up to and into the sea ice, and in the subantarctic South Atlantic including the South Georgia area (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b). The winter distribution is not well known, but at least some and possibly most of the population migrates to lower latitudes in winter. Evidence for this comes from past catches of Antarctic-sized Blue Whales off Angola, Namibia, and South Africa in winter only (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b) and more recently from acoustics: call types characteristic of Antarctic Blue Whales have been recorded in the austral winter just north of the equator in the mid-Atlantic (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2017),&#160; in the southeastern Atlantic on the west coast of South Africa (Bell 2016 ), in the tropical Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific Ocean (Balcazar <em>et al</em>. 2017), and near the GalÃ¡pagos Islands (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, there is also at least some winter presence in high latitudes (ÅiroviÄ <em>et al</em>. 2009, Thomisch <em>et al</em>. 2016) and perhaps some summer presence in mid-latitudes of the Indian Ocean (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013) and southeastern Pacific (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).","The Blue Whale was the subject of major commercial hunting in the past, which ceased in the 1970s.",Marine,"<p>Blue Whales have been protected from commercial hunting by the International Whaling Commission since 1966, although illegal catches by USSR fleets continued until 1972.

This habitat type is identified to have a high conservation value, including a rich fungal biodiversity (von Bonsdorff <em>et al</em>. 2014, BjÃ¸rndalen 2003, Nitare 2011). This kind of habitat type is naturally very small in area and fragmented and it has been assessed as threatened (VU-EN) in Finland and in Norway (Kouki <em>et al</em>. 2018, von Bonsdorff <em>et al</em>. 2014, Artsdatabanken 2018).

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50Âº and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ÂºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive âopen-boatâ hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commissionâs Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The âmodernâ highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and FÃ©lix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as âdepredation.â Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (GonzÃ¡lez and OlivarrÃ­a 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and MÃ¸hl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (AndrÃ© and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through âopen-boatâ whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the âbestâ estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by âcodaâ vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989).
